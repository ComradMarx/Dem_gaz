        An 18-year-old man was arrested Sunday in relation to a shooting in northern Jonesboro, police said. Shortly after 9 p.m. on Saturday, police were notified that a 21-year-old woman had been shot  in the upper ankle of her right leg, near the intersection of French and Bradley streets, according to a Jonesboro Police Department report.  Sally Smith, a spokesperson for the department, said Tuesday that the woman had been transported to a hospital in Memphis for further surgery to repair her leg but was in stable condition.  Keontaye Droughn was arrested on Sunday in connection with the shooting after surrendering to police, the report states.  According to the report, Droughn and the woman got into an argument that resumed after she got off work and picked up the man and his son. When she drove Droughn to his home, Droughn took his son inside, returned with a weapon and shot at her at least three times, according to the report. The woman told police he took her phone and fled the scene.  Droughn was charged with first-degree domestic battery and theft. He was booked into the Craighead County jail, where he remained Tuesday in lieu of $150,000 bond. Police said the woman accused Droughn of at least one previous act of domestic abuse between them that was not reported at the time.

        As summer officially arrives and temperatures in Arkansas continue to rise late into the week, heat-related illnesses will be a serious concern, especially for the homeless and seniors, raising the possibility that a community cooling shelter in Hot Springs will be needed. "At the end of this week, we're going to have temperatures of 100 degrees. With the humidity, that heat index certainly is going to be somewhere around 105, 107. We're going to have temperatures in the next several weeks even higher than that -- I mean, we're in June," Sally Carder, St. Luke's Episcopal outreach coordinator, said Monday. St. Luke's has long provided warming and cooling shelters for the homeless population of Hot Springs. "We're very concerned because we've put out a notice and actually a request for help for churches and organizations -- anyone that has the space that we can have a cooling shelter," she said. In recent years, homelessness has been on the rise in Hot Springs. "You've got to understand that our homeless population has a lot of different kinds of health problems," Carder said. "They've got asthma, they've got all kinds of heart problems, all kinds of things that play into their health. People will say, 'You know, they're out there all the time, they're used to it.' Nobody is used to living 24 hours a day outside when the heat index is that high. Yes, there are people that work out there ... those people go home to air conditioning."  Video not playing? Click here https://www.youtube.com/embed/1QWTdJhlFRo  Carder said they also have a number of lower-income families and individuals, including older people, that live in homes that don't have air conditioning or don't have electricity. "Those people are very much at risk," she said. "I'm disappointed that we put out a call for churches and different organizations, different places, to let us know if they would allow us to have a cooling shelter there (and) we have no one at all that respond(ed) to an email that we've put out." Carder said she does not know of any other organizations running or planning cooling shelters in Hot Springs. "Right now, our church doesn't have air conditioning. We have people that are in there working on that every day, or certainly we'd step up and do something," she said. Cooperative Christian Ministries and Clinic will be the lead agency for cooling shelters and warming shelters in the future, Carder said. "They're going to take the lead on our shelters. They're the ones who put out an email and a request for help," she said. "When we get an excessive heat warning, a dangerous heat warning, then that's when those shelters would kick into place. We're talking about opening at noon and going until 6 p.m. No meals served, but certainly water and Gatorade ... just a place for people to come and sit and cool off during the hottest part of the day," she said. "We're asking churches, businesses, organizations, anybody that is in an area where there are people who need the help, to put out coolers of water, Gatorade, and keep that ice in there so people can come by ... and get one of those to stay hydrated. That's the least we can do," she said. "This week is going to be hot, but there are going to be some major, major days coming up where the heat is just too much for people," Carder said. "So we're asking, if you have an idea of where we can go. If your facility is -- and it doesn't have to be really large ... but a place that has air conditioning. We can certainly help with the electric bill ... we're just looking for a place for the folks that really need the help."

        A cooling center in North Little Rock will open Tuesday morning and stay open until Sunday evening to allow citizens to get relief from the heat. The station is located at the North Little Rock Community Center, 2700 Willow St., and will be open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. each day.  According to a news release from the city, pets are allowed and there will be vending machines in the area. [RELATED: Cooling shelter locations being sought in Hot Springs » arkansasonline.com/621hscooling/] North Little Rock officer Jhailan Rathey, a liaison to the unsheltered community, said the cooling center will be open to the public, with no identification required.  “Right now we can fit about 30 to 40 people,” Rathey said.  According to Rathey, masks and free water will be available to those in the center. He said the reason North Little Rock decided to open a cooling center now was due to forecasted high temperatures near 100 degrees.

        Arkansas' first coronavirus vaccine doses for children under 5 began arriving in the state on Monday, and by the end of the day, some parents had been able to get the shots for their kids. Cory Grummer took her 4-year-old daughter, Lane, to Kavanaugh Pharmacy in Little Rock to get the Moderna vaccine after hearing from a friend that the store had it. "They said that she was the first kid under 5 that they had vaccinated," Grummer said. "She didn't bat an eyelash, and they gave her a bunch of candy and she was happy." Dr. Joel Tumlison, the state Department of Health's medical director for immunizations, said 13 of the 23 vaccine shipments that were in the state's initial two orders had arrived by Monday afternoon, and another was expected later Monday. Four more shipments are expected today. The state hadn't received an expected delivery date on the other five shipments, but Tumlison was hopeful they would arrive by the end of the week. "Frankly, it's gotten here faster to many places than we thought it might," he said. The first wave of deliveries, consisting of 15,000 each of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, are going to nine of the Health Department's local health units that will distribute them to other health units as well as private clinics and pharmacies. The second wave, with 3,100 doses of mostly Pfizer vaccine, includes some shipments that will go directly to hospitals and pharmacies. The second wave was initially expected sometime between Thursday and June 29, but some of those shipments are now expected to arrive today, Tumlison said. Through a federal program that ships doses directly to pharmacies, Kavanaugh Pharmacy received 100 doses of the Moderna vaccine on Monday morning, co-owner Anne Pace said. By the afternoon, it had administered the shots to three or four children, she said. "The parents that were getting [their children] vaccinated, they were ready," Pace said. "I think they've been ready for a while, so they were anxious to get it going." State and federal laws don't allow pharmacists to vaccinate children younger than 3, so Grummer wasn't able to get her 1-year-old son vaccinated on Monday. She said she plans to take him to the doctor to get it once the doctor has doses available. Without the protection of the vaccines, she said her youngest children haven't been able to do things like go to friends' indoor birthday parties, visit the Museum of Discovery or eat indoors in restaurants. "We've just been really careful this whole time, and we feel like getting to the point where we can protect the littlest ones in our family its a step closer to the end for us," Grummer said. Lane, who got a Paw Patrol Band-Aid, said the shot wasn't too bad. "It hurt, but I said 'ow' and that's it," she said. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Friday authorized the Pfizer vaccine for children from 6 months to 4 years of age and the Moderna vaccine for ages 6 months to 5 years. Both vaccines are low-dose versions of the companies' shots that are available to adults. Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, on Saturday endorsed an advisory committee's recommendation that all eligible children receive a vaccine. A vaccine hadn't previously been cleared for children under 5. Tumlison said it will probably be late today or Wednesday before many providers start administering doses. To get the vaccine at a local health unit, people should call ahead to make sure the unit has doses available and to make an appointment, although walk-ins are also accepted, Health Department spokeswoman Danyelle McNeill said. Arkansas Children's, which will offer Pfizer vaccine at its primary care clinics around the state, expects to receive its first doses later this week, spokeswoman Hilary DeMillo said. CHI St. Vincent expects to receive its first shipment of vaccine for children younger than 5 "within the next few days," spokeswoman Bonnie Ward said in an emailed statement. "The vaccine will be available through the ministry's pediatric healthcare providers," Ward said. "Parents interested in having their children age five and under receive the vaccine should contact their child's pediatrician to schedule an appointment." Baptist Health plans to offer the vaccine in its clinics "that currently provide other immunizations for children in that age group," spokeswoman Cara Wade said in an email. "As far as timing, we anticipate hearing more about vaccine distribution from the Arkansas Department of Health," she said. She added that the vaccine "continues to be our best defense against COVID-19." "For parents who have questions about getting their children vaccinated, we recommend talking to your pediatrician or primary care provider, who are trusted with other aspects of guidance for your children's health," Wade said. NEW CASES DOWN Meanwhile, possibly reflecting a slowdown in testing and reporting around the federal Juneteenth holiday, Arkansas' count of coronavirus cases rose Monday by 251, the first daily increase in six days that was smaller than the one a week earlier. After rising the previous two days, the number of people hospitalized in the state with covid-19 fell by 15, to 181. For the third time in four days, the state didn't report any new deaths from covid-19. The state's death toll, as tracked by the Arkansas Department of Health, remained at 11,540. The increase in cases was less than half the size of the one a day earlier and smaller by 81 than the daily rise a week earlier. Due to slowdowns in testing and reporting over the weekends, the state's daily case increases tend to be smaller on Sundays and Mondays than during the rest of the week. The Juneteenth holiday on Sunday, which caused some government offices and businesses to be closed on Monday, may have also affected Monday's new case numbers, Tumlison said. Previously at its highest level since February, the average daily increase in Arkansas' case count over a rolling seven-day period fell Monday to 715. Pulaski County had the most new cases, 45, followed by Sebastian County with 25 and Benton County with 20. The state's cumulative count of cases since March 2020 rose to 855,543. With recoveries outnumbering new cases, the number of cases in the state that were considered active fell by 456, to 8,307 -- the first daily decline in two weeks. After not changing the previous three days, the number of the state's virus patients who were on ventilators rose by four, to 13, the largest number since May 4. The number who were in intensive care, which fell by one on Sunday, rose Monday by seven, to 33. It was the first time the number had been above 30 since April 7. At its hospitals in Little Rock and Springdale, Arkansas Children's had a total of seven covid-19 patients on Monday, down from eight as of Friday, DeMillo said.

        Loretta Hendrix, an announced candidate for the Ward 1 seat on the Little Rock Board of Directors, was injured in a shooting Saturday while driving, according to a Little Rock Police Department report. As of Monday afternoon, Hendrix remained at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences hospital after the incident, she said when reached by phone. Hendrix, 73, is the daughter of the late Ward 1 City Director Erma Hendrix, who died in office last September at age 91. About 10 p.m. Saturday, police responded to 1501 Wright Ave. in reference to a shooting that had just occurred and found Hendrix with an apparent gunshot wound to her left leg and femoral bleeding, according to the police report. After police applied two tourniquets to her injured leg, Hendrix was handed off to paramedics for transportation to UAMS, the report said. In the vehicle's front passenger seat at the time of the shooting was Hendrix's sister, Phyllis Brown, 66, police reported. Brown told police the shooting occurred somewhere in the area of West 15th Street and South State Street, or West 15th Street and South Chester Street, the report said. Officers found multiple shell casings in the roadway and around the property of 811 and 813 W. 15th St. The residence at 813 W. 15th St. had been struck by three bullets, and although police attempted to make contact with a homeowner, no one answered the door, according to the report. Additionally, police dispatched to 1312 W. 15th St. in reference to a bullet that struck the residence at the same time as the reported shooting found a bullet that had entered through an east-facing window. Two 88-year-old individuals were inside with a guest at the time of the shooting, but they were unhurt, the report said. Brown's vehicle, a 2008 Honda CR-V, was towed to the crime scene bay for processing, the report said. At the time of the shooting, Hendrix was returning home from a memorial service for a friend when "we just got caught in between crossfire," she said. "You know, I had never experienced anything like that in my neighborhood." There has been an increase in the number of gunshots in the neighborhood starting approximately a year and a half ago after a long period of quiet, she recalled. A detective visited Hendrix in the hospital on Monday, she said, adding that she expected another visit from police before the day was over. Hendrix had surgery early Sunday morning, she said, and anticipated she would leave the hospital today in order to go to another facility for rehabilitation. Contests for six of the seven ward-specific seats on the Little Rock Board of Directors as well as mayor will be on the ballot during the November election. The board's structure also includes three at-large representatives. Candidate packets are currently available from the city. The filing period will run from July 29 until Aug. 19 at noon. In January, Hendrix announced a bid for mayor, but last month changed her mind and said she would instead run for the Ward 1 seat formerly held by her mother. Hendrix and other potential Ward 1 contenders are expected to face City Director Virgil Miller Jr., whom the city board appointed last year to fill the vacancy left by Erma Hendrix's death. Miller has said he intends to seek a full term of his own during the November election. Winners of the municipal contests will be inaugurated for four-year terms that begin Jan. 1, 2023.

Besides serving as the department's chief legal counsel, Rouse also has served as director of the Office of State Procurement. He will succeed Amy Fecher as the department's secretary, effective July 1. "Mitch has shown his dedication to Arkansas, and I have full confidence that he will continue to lead the transformation efforts," Hutchinson said Monday in a news release. "He has invaluable experience serving the state and will be a great fit as Secretary of Transformation and Shared Services," said the Republican governor, whose eight-year tenure as governor will end in January. As director of the Office of State Procurement, Rouse oversaw the procurement of commodities and services for the state. As chief counsel at the Department of Transformation and Shared Services, he managed a staff of five attorneys and handled legal matters for all divisions under the Department of Transformation and Shared Services. The department includes the Office of the Secretary, the Arkansas Geographic Information Systems Office, the Division of Building Authority, the Division of Information Systems, the Employee Benefits Division, the Office of Personnel Management and the Office of State Procurement, according to its website. Rouse's salary will be $172,094 as the department's secretary, Hutchinson spokeswoman Shealyn Sowers said Monday. That's the salary level Fecher would have received after a merit raise if she had continued as transformation secretary, she said. Rouse's current salary is $140,189 a year and Fecher's current salary is $167,081, according to the Arkansas Transparency website. Fecher has served as the department's secretary since July 2019. Earlier this month, trustees for the Arkansas Public Employees Retirement System voted to hire Fecher as its executive director, starting July 1. As the system's executive director, Rouse will be paid a starting salary of $165,396 a year -- the same salary paid to former system Executive Director Duncan Baird, who departed in April to take a job at Walmart. The system is state government's second-largest retirement benefit with more than $10 billion in investments and more than 75,000 working and retired members. In the governor's office news release, Rouse said he is honored to be appointed by Hutchinson as the department's secretary. "Hard work has afforded me this opportunity, and I look forward to leading this department with energy and integrity." Before joining the Department of Transformation and Shared Services, Rouse was the chief of staff and associate director of the Office of Air Quality at what was formerly called the Department of Environmental Quality. He also served as a federal law clerk for the Honorable D.P. Marshall Jr. in the Eastern District of Arkansas. He graduated magna cum laude from Arkansas State University, where he received bachelor's degrees in English and philosophy. He received his law degree from the William H. Bowen School of Law at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, where he served as editor-in-chief of the UALR Law Review. The state Department of Transformation and Shared Services is one of the state government's 15 executive branch departments. Hutchinson's reorganization of executive branch agencies cut their ranks from 42 to 15, starting in July 2019, under Act 910. Hutchinson's reorganization in 2019 represented the most sweeping overhaul of state government since 1971 when then-Gov. Dale Bumpers, a Democrat, led an initiative to meld 60 agencies into 13 departments under Act 38 of that year.  Print Headline: Rouse to head up department

        A dive team on Monday recovered the body of a 35-year-old man who was reported missing in Beaver Lake in Northwest Arkansas over the weekend. A day earlier, authorities recovered the body of a 22-year-old man who drowned in the Mulberry River in west Arkansas. In the Beaver Lake accident, the Benton County sheriff's office received a call about 9 p.m. Saturday about a man who had fallen off a boat in the lake's Prairie Creek area, said Meyer Gilbert, chief deputy for the sheriff's office. The sheriff's office searched for the man Saturday night and for most of the day Sunday. The search resumed about 7 a.m. Monday, Gilbert said. About 1 p.m. Monday, they found the body of Edwin Jehovany Avila Garcia not far from the boat docks at Prairie Creek, about 100 to 150 yards from the no-wake zone, Gilbert said. "It was quite a bit away from the area of where the witnesses actually said they'd last seen him, so that's why it takes so long," he said. Gilbert said Garcia's death is being handled as a boating accident and the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission will handle the investigation. Garcia was one of seven people on the boat. The other people said Garcia had a medical emergency and fell off the boat, Gilbert said. Garcia's body will be taken to the Benton County coroner's office, Gilbert said. The incident occurred about one year after a similar one in the same area of the lake. A 27-year-old Fayetteville woman was reported as missing after falling out of a boat the evening of June 13, 2021, according to a sheriff's office spokesperson. Emergency responders, after an extensive search, recovered the woman's body two days later. In the Mulberry River accident, a man's body was recovered at 5 p.m. Sunday near the Silver Bridge, which crosses the Mulberry River and is on the line between Crawford and Franklin counties, according to Chief Deputy James Mirus of the Crawford County sheriff's office. In a Facebook post on Sunday evening, Mulberry Mayor Gary Baxter thanked those who assisted in the search and recovery effort at Silver Bridge, which he says began Friday and was led by Mirus. Mirus said Monday afternoon that teams initially responded in an attempt to rescue Edward Bennett, who went underwater. According to the chief deputy, witnesses said Bennett was swimming from side to side and was not a strong swimmer. The sheriff's office hadn't confirmed the identity of the body that was recovered Sunday, he said. The water was low, which Mirus said made it difficult to get resources like dive teams and sonar teams, along with equipment, in the river. "A citizen brought his airboat up because that was the only thing we could get in the water," Mirus said. Baxter also added that another drowning took place in the same location less than four weeks ago, on May 21. First responders transported the victim of that drowning, a man in his late 40s, to a local hospital where he later died. The chief deputy said that Silver Bridge is a popular swimming hole and has been for residents of Mulberry for generations. "In reality we have several drownings a year," Mirus said. "People are looking for free places to swim and cool off. That's the easiest thing to do, the first thing people do is go to the [river.]" Most people don't realize how strong the undercurrent is and get swept away, according to Mirus. He said that paying attention, staying with groups and using flotation devices can help improve safety when participating in water recreation.

         GARDINER, Mont. -- Most of Yellowstone National Park should reopen within the next two weeks -- much faster than originally expected after record floods pounded the region last week and knocked out major roads, federal officials said. Yellowstone Superintendent Cam Sholly said the park will be able to accommodate fewer visitors for the time being and it will take more time to restore road connections with some southern Montana communities. Park officials said Sunday they'll use $50 million in federal highway money to speed up road and bridge repairs. There's still no timetable for repairs to routes between the park and areas of Montana where the recovery is expected to stretch for months. Yellowstone will partially reopen at 8 a.m. Wednesday, more than a week after more than 10,000 visitors were forced out of the park when the Yellowstone and other rivers went over their banks after being swelled by melting snow and several inches of rainfall. Only portions of the park that can be accessed along its "southern loop" of roads will be opened initially, and access to the park's scenic backcountry will be for day hikers only.    Within two weeks officials plan to also open the northern loop, after previously declaring that it would likely stay closed through the summer season. The northern loop would give visitors access to popular attractions, including Tower Fall and Mammoth Hot Springs. They'd still be barred from the Lamar Valley, which is famous for its prolific wildlife, including bears, wolves and bison, that can often be seen from the roadside. "That would get 75 to 80% of the park back to working," National Park Service Director Charles "Chuck" Sams said Sunday during a visit to Yellowstone to gauge the flood's effects. It will take much longer -- possibly years -- to fully restore two badly damaged stretches of road that link the park with Gardiner to the north and Cooke City to the northeast. During a tour of damaged areas on Sunday, park officials showed reporters one of six sections of road near Gardiner where the raging floodwaters obliterated most of the roadway. Muddy water now courses through where the roadbed had been only a week ago. Trunks of huge trees litter the surrounding canyon. With no chances for an immediate fix, Sholly said 20,000 tons of material were being hauled in to construct a temporary, alternate route along an old road that runs above the canyon. That would let employees who work at the park headquarters in Mammoth get to their homes in Gardiner, Sholly said. The temporary route also could be used by commercial tour companies that have permits to lead guided visits. "We've gotten a lot more done than we thought we would a week ago," Sholly said. "It's going to be a summer of adjustments." The scope of the damage is still being tallied by Yellowstone officials, but based on other national park disasters, it could take years and carry a steep price tag to rebuild in an environmentally sensitive landscape -- with a huge underground plumbing system -- where construction season only runs from the spring thaw until the first snowfall. "They'll have to look at all the resources the park is designed to protect, and try to do this project as carefully as possible, but they're also going to try to go fairly quickly," said Brett Hartl, government affairs director at the Center for Biological Diversity. MONTANA TOLL Montana counties have also been surveying their damages. Some of those hardest hit in the disaster -- far from the park's limelight -- are leaning heavily on one another to pull their lives out of the mud. In and around the agricultural community of Fromberg, the Clarks Fork River flooded almost 100 homes and badly damaged a major irrigation ditch that serves many farms. The town's mayor says about a third of the flooded homes are too far gone to be repaired. In Red Lodge, nearly 150 homes were damaged or destroyed after Rock Creek escaped its banks last week. In Park County -- which includes Livingston, Gardiner and Cooke City -- a preliminary assessment of 437 structures found three residences were destroyed, 76 had moderate to major damage and another 126 had minor damage. Eight bridges and seven roads were destroyed, while 16 commercial buildings suffered moderate to major damage, officials said. Stillwater County officials were still tallying the damage there on Monday, following heavy rains on the weekend that caused the rivers to rise again, said Rich Cowger, the fire chief in Columbus. One house at the confluence of Rosebud Creek and the Stillwater River near Absarokee remained threatened on Monday, Cowger said. Elected officials who showed up to tour the damage in Red Lodge and Gardiner -- Montana tourist towns that serve as gateways to Yellowstone -- haven't made it to Fromberg to see its devastation. Matt Holmes combed through piles of muck and debris but could find little to save out of the trailer home that he shared with his wife and four children. Holmes had taken the day off, but said he needed to get back soon to his construction job so he could begin making money again. Whether he can bring in enough to rebuild is unclear. Holmes said he may move the family to Louisiana, where they have relatives. "I want to stay in Montana. I don't know if we can," he said.  Print Headline: Yellowstone set for fast reopening

        SPRINGDALE -- Improvements to existing streets could do as much or more to relieve traffic congestion as a new road, the Springdale City Council was told Monday. The council, meeting as a Committee of the Whole, agreed to recommend spending up to $359,850 for a transportation study by the Garver LLC engineering firm of Fayetteville to find options. Colby Fulfer, city chief of staff, told the council that right-hand turn lanes at the city's most congested intersections, for instance, could help traffic flow more than other options. The study would also identify exactly what projects should go first for design work to proceed, allowing the city to get right to work on those projects as soon as any money is available, Fulfer said. This is a major consideration at a time of rising costs, he said. "We estimate we could have saved 20% to 30% if the last round of projects had been shovel-ready," he said. The council recommended the study, which would have to be approved at a regular council meeting. The council will take up its own recommendation at its next regular meeting June 28. In other business, the council recommended acceptance of a settlement offer from First Presbyterian Church of Springdale in a property condemnation matter. The city wants to extend Har-Ber Avenue from 48th Street to Gutensohn Road, which would require taking some of the church's property. The city originally appraised the value of the property to be taken at $51,800. A private appraisal commissioned by the church valued the property at more than twice that. The church's offer of $91,800 splits the difference between the two appraisals, city staff told the council. Staff recommended the city take the offer since property prices are rising rapidly and the city's first appraisal is already out of date. Prices will keep rising as the matter awaits trial. Trial is set to begin in August, barring delays. Accepting the offer will also take formal action of the council at a regular council meeting. The committee recommended, without debate, accepting the state's offer of a one-time $5,000 stipend to law enforcement officers approved by the state Legislature. The council also explored the option of either reducing or capping the costs of city building permits on projects to repair or rebuild from damage done by the tornado that hit portions of the city on March 30. One city resident rebuilding his house had to spend $1,300 for the necessary permits, the council was told. The original proposal was to reduce permits issued on such projects by 25%, but the council decided any such measure would have to define precisely what would qualify for a cost reduction. City attorney Ernest Cate was assigned to research the matter and have a recommendation ready for the council at its next committee meeting in two weeks.

        More than 18,000 Arkansans cast ballots in early voting for today's primary runoff in which there are contested runoffs for 10 legislative seats and various county offices in 30 of the state's 75 counties. Based on records released Monday by the secretary of state's office, the largest number of early votes had been cast in Baxter, Benton, Boone, Crawford and Greene counties. Voters who cast ballots in the May 24 primary must vote in the same party primary in the runoff, under state law. Voters who didn't vote in the May 24 primary may vote in either party primary in the runoff. There are Republican runoffs for three state Senate seats and seven House of Representatives seats to determine the party's nominees. [VOTER GUIDE: Get the details on which seats have contested runoffs + find your districts » arkansasonline.com/voter-guide/] The highest-profile state Senate runoff is a rematch between Sen. Bob Ballinger of Ozark and former Sen. Bryan King of Green Forest in Senate District 28. "I think we are in good shape, but we won't know until tomorrow," Ballinger, who ousted King in the Republican primary in 2018, said Monday. "If enough Republicans show up, we'll do good." King said that "it is just about turnout" in the runoff. "We'll see," he said. "Primaries are tough." Senate District 28 includes all of Carroll and Madison counties and parts of Boone, Franklin, Johnson and Newton counties. More than 1,000 early votes have been cast in the runoff election in Boone County, according to records released by the secretary of state's office on Monday afternoon. Beckie Benton, election coordinator in Boone County, said Monday the county judge runoff is primarily driving voter turnout, though the Senate District 28 runoff also is luring voters to the polls. Benton County election administrator Dana Caler said Monday afternoon that about 1,350 voters out of the 56,902 eligible runoff voters in Benton County had cast a vote in the runoff. "The runoff is usually lower as always," she said. "We are expecting about 10% total this year. The last primary runoff we had around 7%, but people are interested in the races that are going on right now." Caler said the Republican runoff in Senate District 35, between businessman Tyler Dees of Siloam Springs and state Rep. Gayla Hendren McKenzie of Gravette, and the Pea Ridge School Board elections are driving the interest right now. Washington County election coordinator Jennifer Price said that as of Monday afternoon 557 early votes had been cast during the runoff. "We do expect to see a pretty busy or steady Election Day turnout," she said. Price said she estimates 5% to 10% total turnout among eligible voters for the runoff. "We have a county judge race, a Senate race, a House district race and a constable race," she said, referring to the Senate District 35 runoff and the House District 23 runoff between Lincoln School Board member Kendra Moore and Washington County Quorum Court member Jim Wilson. McKenzie said Monday afternoon that "we are getting a good response. "We'll know more [today]," she said. Dees said he's thankful for the people who have gotten out to vote again in the runoff. "It's probably not wise to make a prediction before we get more info," he said. In the Senate District 22 runoff, state Rep. John Payton of Wilburn said he seems to have a lot of momentum in his bid to oust state Sen. James Sturch of Batesville, based on the feedback he has received on the streets, in restaurants and other places during the runoff. "I'm feeling good about the race," he said. Senate District 22 includes Independence and Sharp counties and parts of Cleburne, Fulton, Lawrence and Izard counties. But Sturch said Monday afternoon that 700 of the early votes in the runoff have been from voters in Independence County, and 270 of the early votes have been from voters in Cleburne County. "Giving it all we got!" he said in a text message. "Running [until] the end. Turnout is about 10% of what it was." In the House District 52 runoff in which he faces a challenge from farmer Mike Jones of Dardanelle, House Republican leader Marcus Richmond of Gravelly said he received an endorsement from Republican gubernatorial nominee Sarah Huckabee Sanders of Little Rock a few weeks ago. "We put it out there and kind of let other people make a big deal about it," he said. "I try not to overplay anything that we got going on. ... I really do appreciate her stepping up and doing that for me." House District 52 includes Scott County, two-thirds of Yell County and part of southern Sebastian County. But Jones said he doesn't think Sanders' endorsement of Richmond "has a whole lot of traction. "We haven't heard that that really hurt us," he said. More than 1,600 early votes have been cast in the runoff in Baxter County and more than 1,500 votes have been cast in the runoff in Crawford County, according to figures released by the secretary of state's office Monday afternoon. In Baxter County, "it's the county judge's race that's drawing in the people," said Canda Reese, county clerk and circuit clerk for Baxter County. In Crawford County, the runoffs for county judge, sheriff and clerk are helping drive voter turnout, said Ronda Robins, deputy county clerk. In Pulaski County, about 210, or less than 1% of eligible voters, had cast ballots in the runoff election, according to the Pulaski County Election Commission. Amanda Dickens, assistant election coordinator for the Pulaski County Election Commission, said numbers are usually low during a runoff election. "One of the races is for constable, and that is not something voters are normally familiar with or what drives them out to the polls," she said. "The [justice of the peace] race has drawn out a little more people, but not much more. If it had been a higher-ranking office we would have gotten a lot more -- for example, if it was a state rep or something like that. But for that type of race it's probably typical." Dickens said she expects around 2% to 3% turnout total for the runoff election. According to the secretary of state's website, 457,856, or 26%, of the state's 1.76 million registered voters cast ballots in the May 24 primary.

        Sandwiched between cases Friday in federal court in Little Rock, U.S. District Judge Lee Rudofsky presided over a different kind of hearing in which college students participating in a state government internship program watched a sentencing hearing and then questioned the judge on a variety of topics related to his job. After the sentencing hearing, Rudofsky spent about 40 minutes talking with participants in the state's MyARIntern program, describing the confirmation process that placed him on the federal bench and answering questions ranging from who his judicial heroes are to what his favorite part of his job is. The 47 students were on a field trip as part of a statewide public service intern program -- dubbed the MyARIntern Program -- which is a function the state's Department of Transformation and Shared Services "The intent of the program is to offer college students exposure to public service and government for encouragement toward that field," said Jana Hiland, the program director and human resources director with the department. Hiland said the ultimate goal of the program is to interest college students in public service by providing exposure to the inner workings of government through paid summer internships. On Friday, the students, who serve as interns in state government departments, such as the governor's office, Department of Human Services, and Department of Finance and Administration, visited the U.S. District Courthouse in Little Rock, as well as the state Supreme Court and other offices as part of the summer program's mission to educate its interns in the various functions of government and how different entities at different levels interact. In Rudofsky's courtroom, the interns sat in on a lengthy and detailed sentencing hearing in which a Lonoke County man was sentenced to more than 17 years in federal prison on a weapons charge as an armed career criminal. After giving the group an overview of his education, experience and the route he took that led to his nomination to the federal bench by former President Donald Trump in 2019, the New York native and Harvard-educated jurist took questions for nearly a half-hour, clearly enjoying the back-and-forth discussion. Rudofsky's judicial heroes, he said, are two U.S. Supreme Court justices who sit on opposite ends of the ideological spectrum: Justices Clarence Thomas and Elena Kagan. Of Thomas, a Supreme Court justice since 1991 following his nomination by former President George H.W. Bush, he said, "He is a very good and committed jurist ... committed to his way of judging regardless of the result in a particular case." Rudofsky said he took a class taught by Kagan at Harvard Law School and said since that time he had always had a "great relationship" with the justice, who served as dean of Harvard Law School from 2003 until 2009 when she was named U.S. solicitor general by former President Barack Obama, who nominated her for the high court the following year. "I think she kind of used me as kind of the token conservative in her class so we would often argue back and forth on issues of administrative law," he said. "She was a wonderful teacher, a wonderful dean but I think she used me in some sense to engage the class in a real discussion ... I also think she is very committed -- in a good way -- to her jurisprudential philosophy. She and I may disagree more than we don't but I think she does not care what the result is in a particular case. She does what she thinks the law requires and I admire that." Asked his favorite part of the job, Rudofsky paused for a moment to consider the question, then said collaborating with his law clerks on the drafting of rulings by hashing out the issues and researching legal precedents is the part he enjoys the most. "When we have meaty issues that are hard to figure out," he said, "I think it is kind of fun to go back and forth." Rudofsky said he employs an open-door policy and encourages vigorous debate among his clerks in attempting to find the best way forward. "I need to talk things out," he said. "I need to shoot ideas off of people, they come back and say this works or this doesn't work. When I was a practicing attorney that's always how it was and to me, that's always what our writing process tends to be like. ... I walk into their offices with issues I'm trying to figure out, they walk into my office with things I'm trying to figure out and to the extent there is fun in this job, the fun is really trying to figure out how to get to the right answer when there's a difficult problem." Rudofsky said although some cases are easy, three-quarters of the cases that come across his docket "present at least one hard, debatable issue" that he said once decided still leave room for some doubt and further examination. Then, going further, he addressed what he said is the hardest part of the job. "The hardest part of the job and the only part of the job that I lose sleep over is what you just saw," Rudofsky said, referring the sentencing hearing that preceded the question and answer session. "That is incredibly difficult, incredibly emotionally draining, you literally have someone's life in your hands." He said such decisions not only place the life of the defendant under the will of the judge, but also the lives of others including family members, past victims and their families, and potential future victims should a guilty defendant go on to commit more crimes. The intricacies in crafting a sentence that is -- to follow the legal sentencing framework that it be "sufficient but no more than necessary," to address the criminal behavior that brings defendant and judge together, to promote respect for the law and to provide deterrence to the defendant and to others -- is daunting, he said. "You don't want to take away their freedom for a day more than you have to, right?" Rudofsky said. "That's a terrible, terrible thing, but you also don't want to have a situation where someone gets out earlier than they should, they haven't been rehabilitated and, God forbid, they kill someone or hurt someone or they hurt society. That's an incredibly tough thing to figure out and the truth is, there's no right answer." Arkansas' Department of Transformation and Shared Services bills the MyARIntern Program as a tool to provide college students, recent college graduates and veterans with real-world experience in state government through paid internships in a variety of state government career fields. Hiland said those selected for the program, now in its second year, receive $12 an hour in compensation for working inside the state departments they are assigned to.

         100 years ago June 21, 1922 FAYETTEVILLE -- Courses in practical wireless will be emphasised at the University of Arkansas summer school this year. At least three courses dealing directly with radio will be offered, and a considerable amount of interest is expected in the subject outside the classroom. Prof. Giles E. Ripley, head of the University Department of Physics, will offer a regular course in practical and theoretical wireless, using all the University radio apparatus in connection with the course, and considering such matters as the overcoming of static, securing the best results from various types of receiving and sending sets, proper erection of aerials, and similar subjects. 50 years ago June 21, 1972 The state Education Department has announced that Arkansas is one of five states to receive planning grants for expansion of an education program for low-income children. The $50,000 Arkansas grant was made for the Education Department to develop a plan that could be used by other states in the Follow Through program, designed to help low-income children in the first three grades. After the planning period, Arkansas will be eligible to receive $1 million for Follow Through programs in eight to 10 new school districts. The plan will determine how the committees will be selected and the money spent. 25 years ago June 21, 1997 PINE BLUFF -- Sparks from a cutting torch caused a fire that destroyed the Townsend Park Elementary School Wednesday afternoon, Fire Marshal David Parsley said Thursday. A worker using a torch to remove windows on the east wing of the school at 2601 Fluker St. ignited some wooden casings that surrounded windows. The flames quickly spread to the attic and soon swallowed the building, Parsley said. No charges will be brought against the worker. "It was just an accidental fire," Parsley said. The loss of the U-shaped complex was valued at $1.5 million. 10 years ago June 21, 2012 This October, almost 180 World War II veterans from Arkansas will board two US Airways Airbus planes bound for Washington, D.C., from Little Rock. Doctors, nurses and chaperones, called "guardians," will accompany the men and women to the National World War II Memorial, which was dedicated to their service in 2004. "They don't evidently trust us 91-year-old guys to be alone," former Air Force pilot Donald Anderson, of Horseshoe Bend, joked. He turns 91 on Oct. 6. It's an "honor flight," a free visit to the nation's capital provided by the Electrical Cooperatives of Arkansas, Wal-Mart Foundation and Tyson Foods. Since October 2009, five honor flights from the Northwest Arkansas Regional Airport have granted 432 Arkansas veterans the chance to visit the monument some of their comrades never lived to see.

         Little Rock police on Monday morning said investigators were still working to identify the victim of a weekend shooting. Officers responded to a ShotSpotter alert shortly after 2:40 a.m. Sunday in the area of 1321 S. Jefferson St., according to a police report. Officers searched the area and found the victim, a male who had an apparent gunshot wound. He was later pronounced dead, the report stated. A preliminary investigation did not turn up the victim's identity, and the body was transported by the Pulaski County coroner's office to the Arkansas State Crime Laboratory for an autopsy and testing for positive identification, according to the department. Detectives determined the shooting was "isolated" and that no threat is present for the area, authorities said. They asked anyone with information related to the homicide to contact detectives at (501) 371-4660. Tips can be submitted anonymously by calling (501) 371-4636 or through the "YourLRPD" smartphone app.  Print Headline: LR police: Shot man dies from injuries

        EL DORADO -- The jury trial for an El Dorado man charged with first-degree murder is set to begin Monday at the Union County Courthouse. Ronald Pierce, 51, was arrested Sept. 5, 2020, and charged in the killing of Willie Candley. The trial is scheduled to last two days, according to a trial docket sheet issued for Judge Hamilton Singleton's 13th Judicial District, Division 1 courtroom. A trial date in late April was delayed because Pierce's attorney, Jimmy Morris, had another trial scheduled on the same day elsewhere in the state. According to court records, El Dorado police responded to a call Sept. 5, 2020, on Marsh Avenue and upon arrival officers observed a suspect and a knife with blood on the picnic table in the front yard. Officers also noted a victim lying in the yard and bleeding. Police later identified Pierce as a suspect and Willie Candley as the victim. Pierce was arrested and Candley was transported to the Medical Center of South Arkansas, where he died of his injuries. A witness told investigators that Pierce asked them for a gun "prior to stabbing Candley," documents state. Pierce "subsequently confessed" when investigators interviewed him, according to court documents, saying he had been involved in a "physical altercation" with Candley and asked the witness for a gun but was denied. Pierce also told police he "stabbed Candley in the torso," according to documents.

        FAYETTEVILLE -- Those interested have until the end of the month to take part in a community needs survey that will help shape a new strategic plan for the library. An online survey is posted to the library's website, faylib.org. It will stay open until June 30. The library has contracted with consultant Ivy Group in Charlottesville, Va., on a community assessment effort. The group so far has led six community focus groups, two community needs forums and three staff visioning sessions to evaluate needs and library support, according to information presented to the library's board on Monday. The library also has taken part in a benchmark study to see where it stacks up to other libraries across the country, receiving high marks across several categories, Executive Director David Johnson told the board. Feedback from community leaders also will be integrated into the assessment, he said. The online survey has netted about 650 responses, Johnson said. An internal library staff survey also will remain open until the end of the month, he said. The goal is have the assessment completed by late July, Johnson said. The library will then be able to come up with an updated strategic plan, he said. "It's going to help us get a road map for the future," Johnson said. The most recent strategic plan was the library's master plan released in 2012. The plan said the library needed to double its size and would need millage increase to do it. City voters approved a property tax increase in 2016 to build an expanded library, which opened in January 2021. "We're starting the work now to say what are we going to need to do, where do we need to be, as the community grows," Johnson said. In other business, Johnson told board members the city is interested in doing more sidewalk and street work south of the library. The city's contractor associated with construction of the cultural arts corridor downtown, Nabholz, has been using the open acre south of the library to stage their work. The original plan for the Fay Jones woods portion of the arts corridor was to have street and sidewalk work done on West Avenue extending to South Street. On Friday, city officials contacted library administration, saying the work could extend farther south to Prairie Street. In addition, improvements could be made on South School Avenue to Archibald Yell Boulevard and portions of South Street, Johnson said. The city asked the library for more time to use the open acre for staging construction work, saying it could take until November, Johnson said. Johnson told board members he wanted to revisit the agreement with the city to potentially have some improvements made to the library property in exchange for its extended use, such as plumbing for sprinklers or electrical work.

        HOT SPRINGS -- A Little Rock man on parole who fled from a traffic stop in March, prompting a high-speed pursuit that ended when spike strips were deployed, was sentenced to five years in prison Monday after pleading guilty in Garland County Circuit Court. Zachary Remington Dixon, 25, who has remained in custody since his arrest March 10, pleaded guilty to felony fleeing, punishable by up to 10 years in prison, and was sentenced to five years. An additional felony charge of first-degree criminal mischief was withdrawn in district court along with numerous misdemeanor charges and traffic violations. According to court records, Dixon was convicted Nov. 7, 2017, in Garland County of possession of a firearm by certain persons and sentenced to six years in prison, but later paroled. He was previously convicted in 2016 in Garland County of possession of drug paraphernalia and sentenced to five years in prison. According to the probable cause affidavit, around 9:45 a.m. March 10, Arkansas State Police Trooper 1st Class Dylan Robbins was patrolling in the area of Central Avenue near Amity Road when he saw a white Ford sport utility vehicle with expired tags. He got behind the SUV as it turned onto Amity and then pulled into a parking spot at Harps Food Store, 5536 Central Ave., and activated his lights to make a traffic stop, according to the court records. A white female passenger got out and walked toward Robbins while the driver, later identified as Dixon, opened his door and looked at the trooper while saying "something about a job interview." Dixon then shut the door and sped off, heading west on Amity with Robbins in pursuit. He noted that Dixon "demonstrated complete disregard for the safety and welfare of motorists by traveling at a high rate of speed and passing in no-passing zones, passing in blind curves and passing over blind hilltops." Robbins said Dixon forced numerous motorists to "run off the roadway" by getting in their lane. During the pursuit, they passed a Garland County sheriff's deputy who began to follow and alerted other deputies including one ahead of them who said he would put out a spike strip. The SUV continued passing other vehicles at a high rate of speed, Robbins said, noting that when he would get closer to attempt a PIT maneuver, the driver would "brake check" him. A PIT, or "precision immobilization technique," maneuver is a method used by some law enforcement agencies to stop fleeing vehicles by temporarily disabling them. As they passed South Moore Road, Robbins was advised the spike strip had been deployed "just ahead of us" so he backed off as the SUV hit the strip. The SUV continued about half a mile before the driver lost control, left the roadway, struck a wooden sign and stopped in a ditch. Dixon attempted to drive out of the ditch, so Robbins put the front of his unit against the driver's side door to keep him from getting back on Amity. Robbins got out and began giving orders to Dixon, but he reportedly refused to roll his window down so Robbins broke the window to get to him. Robbins and Trooper Justin Parker finally pulled Dixon out and took him to the ground. When asked, Dixon reportedly said he was not injured and declined to be checked out by LifeNet personnel. A computer check showed that Dixon had warrants for parole violations and from other agencies. He was set for an arraignment Monday, but opted to plead guilty instead at the hearing.

        A Shannon Hills police officer resigned Monday after being charged Saturday night with felony theft of a motor vehicle, assault in the first degree, driving while intoxicated and refusal to submit to chemical testing. Jose Padilla, 30, of Alexander, remained in the Pulaski County jail Monday with no bond set. Shannon Hills Police Chief Allen Spears confirmed Padilla resigned Monday. An off-duty Little Rock officer was working at Trinity night club at about 4:55 a.m. when he noticed a commotion nearby on 1021 Jessie Road, according to a police report. A group of men told the officer Padilla had stolen a vehicle, the report stated. The officer noted he saw Padilla nearly hit multiple pedestrians while attempting to flee from the location. The Little Rock officer tried to pull Padilla from the vehicle, the report stated. It stated that another witness punched Padilla in the side of the head at the same time. Padilla was detained and the Little Rock officer contacted the owner of the vehicle. The vehicle's owner told police he was helping an intoxicated family member when Padilla entered the vehicle and began to drive away. Padilla had slurred speech, appeared to be drowsy and smelled of alcohol, according to the report. His eyes were also bloodshot and watery and he had trouble standing, according to authorities. An ambulance transported Padilla to the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences in Little Rock, where he became combative with medical staff, the report stated. He was admitted into the intensive care unit at the hospital and later transported to the Pulaski County jail.  Print Headline: Jailed Shannon Hills officer resigns

        A man was fatally shot on Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard in Texarkana about noon on Monday, police said. The man, whose identity was withheld, died at a hospital, said Cpl. Kelly Pilgreen of the Texarkana Police Department. Officers were dispatched to a shooting in the 300 block of Martin Luther King Boulevard and the 700 block of Laurel Street in Texarkana. When they arrived in the 300 block of Martin Luther King Boulevard, officers found a dark-colored sedan had crashed into a residence, Pilgreen said. The driver appeared to have a gunshot wound. A female passenger was possibly injured from the crash, Pilgreen said. The driver and passenger were transported to a local hospital. The man's identity has been held until the next of kin can be notified. The female's identity is also being withheld because she is a victim in the case, police said. A warrant has been issued for Trenkale Martinez Brunson, 29, of Texarkana, who is wanted for murder in the first degree, possession of a firearm by certain persons and unlawful discharge of a firearm from a vehicle, Pilgreen said. The investigation is ongoing, the department said.  Print Headline: 1 killed, 1 hurt in Texarkana shooting

        A man from Lakeview, who has chosen to remain anonymous under Arkansas law, has become a millionaire by winning a top prize in the lottery on Friday, according to a news release. He claimed his prize last Wednesday at the Arkansas Scholarship Lottery Claim Center in Little Rock. The winning ticket was sold from Michael Gas N Go, which will receive $10,000 in commission for selling the winning ticket, according to a news release.  According to the news release, the winner was playing the $1,000,000 Riches game. The ticket is a scratch-off where winning numbers are on the ticket and players reveal the other 25 spots to see if any of the numbers match.  Ashley McNatt, a spokesperson for the Arkansas Scholarship Lottery, said the chances of winning overall are 1 in 2.99. According to the Arkansas Scholarship Lottery website, the odds of winning a top prize are 1 in 800,000.  Since the $1,000,000 Riches game began on Nov. 2, 2021 only half of the $1 million prizes available have been won, meaning two of the top-prize tickets remain.  According to the news release, the Lakeview man is the 86th person in the state that has won a lottery prize worth at least a million dollars since 2009.  A state law, Act 889, allows lottery members who win over $500,000 to remain anonymous. Since the law went into effect on April 25, 2021 every winner has chosen to remain anonymous, according to McNatt.  McNatt said that someone also won the Natural State Jackpot on Saturday, a total of $520,000, but has not yet come forward to claim the prize.

         ROGERS -- A dive team on Monday recovered the body of a man who went missing in Beaver Lake over the weekend. The Benton County Sheriff's Office received a call around 9 p.m. Saturday about a man who had fallen off a boat in the lake's Prairie Creek area, said Meyer Gilbert, chief deputy for the Sheriff's Office. The Sheriff's Office searched for the man Saturday night and for most of the day Sunday. The search resumed at about 7 a.m. Monday, Gilbert said. At about 1 p.m. Monday, they found the body of Edwin Jehovany Avila Garcia, 35, not far from the boat docks at Prairie Creek, about 100 to 150 yards from the no-wake zone, Gilbert said. "It was quite a bit away from the area of where the witnesses actually said they'd last seen him, so that's why it takes so long," he said. The body will be transported to the Benton County Coroner's Office, he said.  Print Headline: Body found in Beaver Lake

        Authorities on Sunday recovered the body of a 22-year-old man who drowned in the Mulberry River. The mans body was recovered at 5 p.m. on Sunday near the Silver Bridge, which crosses the Mulberry River and is on the line between Crawford and Franklin counties, according to Chief Deputy James Mirus of the Crawford County sheriffs office.  In a Facebook post on Sunday evening, Mulberry Mayor Gary Baxter thanked those who assisted in the search and recovery effort at Silver Bridge, which he says began Friday and was led by Mirus. Mirus said Monday afternoon that teams initially responded in an attempt to rescue Edward Bennett, who went underwater. According to the chief deputy, witnesses said Bennett was swimming from side to side and was not a strong swimmer.  The sheriffs office hadnt confirmed the identity of the body that was recovered Sunday, he said. The first goal of authorities is to rescue drowning victims, according to Mirus, but after 20 to 30 minutes of searching the efforts shift toward body recovery and more resources are called in. The water was low, which Mirus said made it difficult to get resources like dive teams and sonar teams, along with equipment, in the river.  “A citizen brought his airboat up because that was the only thing we could get in the water,” Mirus said.  Baxter also added that another drowning took place in the same location less than four weeks ago, on May 21. First responders transported the victim of that drowning, a man in his late 40s, to a local hospital where he later died.  The chief deputy said that Silver Bridge is a popular swimming hole and has been for residents of Mulberry for generations.  “In reality we have several drownings a year,” Mirus said. “People are looking for free places to swim and cool off. Thats the easiest thing to do, the first thing people do is go to the [river.]”  Most people dont realize how strong the undercurrent is and get swept away, according to Mirus.   He said that paying attention, staying with groups and using flotation devices can help improve safety when participating in water recreation.

        Turtles are on the move all over Arkansas, and many can be found alongside roads in rural and suburban areas thanks to a wet, relatively cool spring that created excellent foraging areas in ditches and grassy areas beside the hustle of daily traffic. Many turtles are finishing up their annual breeding and egg-laying cycles, which also puts them on the move. The three-toed box turtle is one of the most common turtles motorists will encounter in The Natural State. Two species of box turtle occur in the state, the three-toed and the ornate, the latter of which is protected and is illegal to possess or collect. Box turtles get their name from the hinged plastron (lower shell). Many turtles can retract into their shells, but box turtles can lift their lower shell to completely seal out any would-be attackers, forming a snug "box" of protection. Most first encounters people may have with a box turtle they've disturbed will be a waiting game until the reptile decides it is safe to open up and take a look around. This ingenious defense makes adult box turtles impervious to attacks by many small predators, leaving disease and automobiles as the top causes of an individual turtle's demise. It also endears it to curious children and adults, who often pick them up and bring them home as a wildlife pet. While no current data is available to support any declines in three-toed box turtle populations in Arkansas, biologists at the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission say movement of these animals may have impacts on population dynamics on a small scale. Kelly Irwin, herpetological program coordinator for the AGFC, says three-toed box turtles often will stay within the same 10- to 25-acre range for their entire life and have a strong homing instinct. If they are moved outside of this area, they may spend the rest of their lives wandering, trying to reorient themselves, especially if turtles are already present in the area where they are placed. "One recent study moved a number of box turtles to a new location and tracked their movements," Irwin said. "Only 47 percent of those moved established a home range in the new area. The rest wandered away or died." Irwin says the issue is compounded by the turtle's relatively long time to reach sexual maturity. "Box turtles can take between 5 and 10 years to become sexually mature, depending on their sex and the conditions where they live," Irwin said. "They can have multiple clutches of 2 to 6 eggs per year, but the nest and young are susceptible to raccoons, skunks, foxes, snakes and many other small predators." Research by Kurt Buhlmann and Gina Coffman at the University of Georgia's Savannah River Ecology Laboratory in 2001 also indicates that fire ants can have detrimental effects to turtle hatchlings as they emerge from their eggs. According to the research, ants could not penetrate turtle's eggs unless there were imperfections on the egg's surface, but did swarm on hatchlings as they began to break free of the egg. Dr. Jenn Ballard, state wildlife veterinarian for the AGFC, says moving or concentrating turtles also can introduce or distribute diseases or parasites to new areas, which can have far-reaching impacts on populations of turtles. A number of viruses and bacteria can cause serious problems for amphibians and reptiles, including box turtles. With few options for treating animals in the wild, preventing the spread of these pathogens to new areas is important for protecting these species. "Moving them around the state can increase the spread of disease, but having them in captivity with other wildlife pets can expose them to even more pathogens," Ballard said. "If one animal has a disease, you've just increased the chances for all of them to contract it, and if they're later released, you may be infecting a new area." If someone wants to release a turtle they've held in captivity, they must find a permitted rehabilitator to ensure the turtle is able to survive and does not pose a risk of spreading disease or parasites it may have picked up during its time as a pet. Ballard says there are some rehabilitators who specialize in turtles among the ones listed on the AGFC's website at www.agfc.com/rehab. "I'd advise anyone to please contact these folks before trying to release a turtle on their own," Ballard said. "Or better yet, think about this before they decide to take in a turtle from the wild. It's just as enjoyable to watch them in their natural setting as it is to bring them home." Another common practice by budding nature lovers is to mark or cover a turtle's shell in paint so it will be recognized upon future visits. Ballard says such practices may seem like harmless fun, but they can impact the turtle greatly. Painting a turtle a bright color not only makes it easier for you to see, it makes it easier for predators to locate. Although most small mammals cannot get into a box turtle's shell a persistent coyote can eventually work its way through to the turtle underneath. "You're really painting a target on the turtle's back," Ballard said. Paints also can be toxic to turtles, depending on the type used. They can block UV light needed by the turtle throughout its life cycle. "The shell is a living part of the turtle," Ballard said. "Hindering UV light absorption impacts Vitamin D production, which is vital to the turtle for bone and shell development." Irwin says enjoying reptiles and amphibians in the wild is one of the experiences that led him on the path to being a part of their conservation, and he encourages people to continue enjoying them in their natural setting. "With the exception of venomous snakes, reptiles and amphibians are one of the few groups of animals someone could get close to and observe without fear or danger to them or the animals," Irwin said. "I think it's great that people enjoy these animals, and picking up an occasional box turtle, bullfrog or speckled kingsnake isn't going to hurt things, but they do need to think about any consequences of moving them from the habitat where they were found. And doing things like painting them or marking them can only cause stress or make them more vulnerable to predation or disease."

        Little Rock police on Monday morning said investigators were still working to identify the victim of a weekend shooting. Officers responded to a ShotSpotter alert shortly after 2:40 a.m. Sunday in the area of 1321 S. Jefferson St., according to a police report.   Officers searched the area and found the victim, a male who had an apparent gunshot wound. He was later pronounced dead, the report states.  A preliminary investigation did not turn up the victims identity, and the body was transported by the Pulaski County coroners office to the Arkansas State Crime Laboratory for an autopsy and testing for positive identification, according to a news release from the department.  According to authorities, detectives determined the shooting was “isolated” and that no threat is present for the area.  Authorities asked anyone with information related to the homicide to contact detectives at (501) 371-4660. Tips can be submitted anonymously by calling (501) 371-4636 or through the “YourLRPD” smartphone app.

        After opening a year and a half ago as a lounge bar inside the historic Malco Theatre, the Malco Lounge will soon add a new food menu to its offerings. The lounge, which opens every day but Sunday at 5 p.m., currently features a full beer, wine and soft drinks concession. Will Roddenberry, bar manager, and Brian Townley, Malco general manager, said they are excited about the new menu coming up. Just weeks into his new position after serving as chef at The Vault, Townley said the new menu will feature a "carnival theme," with such offerings as sandwiches on a doughnut, stuffed corn dogs, and old-fashioned burgers and ham and cheese sandwiches. "Nothing too heavy, just to kind of take a play on some of the carnival foods and make them our own," he said. "It's not going to be real fancy but it's going to be some good stuff for sure. ... Just stuff like that -- little fun stuff." The additions will join an already hefty array of drinks to offer, many of which are unique to Arkansas. Roddenberry, who comes from a background richly steeped in the food and drink business, as his parents opened the famed Rod's Pizza Cellar nearly 50 years ago, said they have all of the domestic beers people are accustomed to, as well as some "wonderful" microbrews that are out of Little Rock, Ireland, Oregon and a few other places. "The wines are mostly California," he said. "But we offer like a sauvignon blanc from New Zealand and a really nice riesling from Austria. And then we've got a Rose from France, and then some wonderful Secco, which is like Champagne." He said people love to order the wines, but as far as what is most popular among the beers, he said it is about 50-50.  [Video not showing up above? Click here to watch » youtube.com/watch?v=WYx0pBGyw48/] "Half the people want your domestics that they're accustomed to, and the other half, they either pick a microbrew that they're used to, or people want to try local beers when they travel. And then we have some really good ciders made in Northwest Arkansas from a black apple company -- made with Arkansas Black apples. And then we have Scarlet Letter seltzers," he said. Townley and Roddenberry noted it is still unclear when the food menu will be available, but hope it is sooner than later. In keeping with its somewhat mysterious air of disposition, Roddenberry said many people still do not know the lounge is there. Located right next to the 290-seat historic Malco Theatre on the corner of Central Avenue and Chapel Street -- the same site which once hosted the Princess Theatre that showed silent films and vaudeville acts in the early 1900s -- Maxwell Blade renovated the lounge in early 2020. Blade, who performs his six-day-a-week magic show in the theater, formerly used the spot as a museum of oddities. Known as Maxwell Blade's Odditorium and Curiosities Museum, it closed after five years in operation, two of which were at the theater. Much of the items from the museum, however, were able to stay. Townley and Roddenberry described the lounge's ambience as "eclectic" and "magical." The walls are adorned with Blade's original paintings, which are for sale, Roddenberry noted, and items from Blade's personal collection line the shelves and other areas of the room. "Pretty eclectic group of pieces -- everything from Indonesian marionettes, to the Gene Autry cap gun, to the African Art pieces to -- I mean, you name it, the guy's got it. He owns everything from a suit of armor to an old Corvette. If you're ever looking for something, don't buy it. Call me and I'll talk to Max. He's probably got it," Roddenberry said, laughing. The lounge was built using repurposed materials from the 2016 Malco Theatre renovation. The marquee on the back bar is the original off the front of the building, while the bar top is made from glass salvaged from the renovations done to the old hotel above the theater. The counters on the back bar are made from the oak wood of the original Malco stage. The project also added a smaller, more intimate, second soundstage in the back, which holds 50 people and hosts a variety of live performances. It features an "open mic" night every Thursday night. "We've done it for about 10 weeks and it's going really well, he said. "Nice crowd of people, so you see really, really talented local musicians." Looking to the future, Roddenberry said he wants to open up the entire lounge, where it is currently sectioned in two pieces, and make it one big room. "I want to put the stage and the marquee to the very back of the room, where we can have music shows, concerts, seat more people -- where it's not split up the way it is now. We'll have more options," he said.

        The board president of the Downtown Little Rock Partnership in a recent letter to the Little Rock Board of Directors said that much of the city's downtown is in "a state of disrepair," impeding efforts to rebound from the covid-19 pandemic. The letter from Carol Worley asked for an allocation of at least $1 million for downtown Little Rock from the city's latest tranche of American Rescue Plan Act funding. "The struggle to regain our pre-2020 status is real," Worley wrote in the letter dated June 6. "This funding was given to the city to help make a difference in areas of need. Let's take this opportunity to use this money as intended and give the urban core of our capital city the attention it deserves." Members of the city board are expected to vote soon on a plan for how to spend the lion's share of the second and final portion of $18.8 million from the federal government. The covid-19 economic rescue package signed by President Joe Biden in March 2021 included $350 billion in direct aid for non-federal governmental entities like states, counties and cities, including Arkansas' capital. Little Rock's total allocation of more than $37 million was the largest among all the cities in Arkansas receiving aid. The first half was received in May 2021. City board members have heard two initial proposals for how to spend $12.35 million of the latest tranche: one from city staff that Little Rock's intergovernmental relations manager, Emily Jordan Cox, laid out recently, followed by another version from Ward 6 City Director Doris Wright. Cox presented the proposed spending plan to board members on May 31. Wright's spending plan was discussed at a board meeting Tuesday. Her resolution is set to be added to the board's agenda for possible action at this week's meeting, as long as enough of her colleagues vote in favor of the addition. Both plans include money for a downtown master plan and other needs. The version from city staff would allocate $500,000 for downtown capital needs and the master plan, but the Downtown Little Rock Partnership would be required to raise the money for any remaining costs related to the master plan. Wright's version increased the sum for the downtown category to $1.5 million. Following discussions with Wright, Little Rock Mayor Frank Scott Jr. suggested at the most recent city board meeting that officials might try to bring forward another spending proposal that incorporates items city officials can all agree on. Downtown Little Rock has not had a master plan since Ottenheimer Market Hall in the River Market was completed in the early 1990s, according to Worley's letter. "During the pandemic, our downtown, more so than everywhere else, was shut down. Offices were left vacant, restaurants were closed, small businesses discontinued operations and commercial spaces were abandoned," Worley wrote. "As you all know, our downtown is not rebounding from the pandemic like other areas of the city. It is unlikely it will with the current model we have in place." Worley called for "a new path forward" for downtown Little Rock, referring to the need for ideas about rethinking land use as well as "hybrid ideas" for spaces to live and work. "Something that will show us creative repurposing of existing buildings so that they will be functional and accommodating for all types of workers and employers," Worley wrote. "That's why the new master plan is so important." She later wrote, "Our downtown businesses, hotels and restaurants are desperately trying to rebound from the loss of our downtown patrons. Sadly, a lot of our downtown area is in a state of disrepair, which impedes efforts of reactivating the area." Worley suggested that bringing life back to the downtown ought to start at "eye level," and said that at a minimum, officials need to fix broken signs and lighting, repair potholes, repaint crosswalks and address graffiti, among other things. She also argued that sprinkler systems for planters and streetscapes would reduce the manpower currently needed for watering. "Better street lighting would allow for increased safety at night; more effective trash receptacles would help control our littered streets; and fixing the downtown potholes would be an immediately visible benefit to visitors, residents and workers," Worley wrote. A minimum $1 million allocation for downtown Little Rock "would be a good start for many of these items, including the much-needed master plan," Worley wrote. Worley is a local attorney with the firm Worley, Wood & Parrish. In a phone interview Friday, she suggested that the master plan itself would be created by an outside firm and then the Downtown Little Rock Partnership would ideally "be able to help coordinate setting the things in motion to move in the direction of whatever the plan is." She envisioned a separate group of developers and other key downtown players who could help officials focus on what they want with the master plan and assist with writing the request for proposals in order to identify the appropriate company. The Downtown Little Rock Partnership is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization separate from Little Rock's municipal government that nevertheless receives significant funding from the city. The city's 2022 budget approved late last year included an outside-agency allocation of $195,000 for the Downtown Little Rock Partnership in exchange for various services, up from $145,000 in the 2021 budget. During the May 31 board meeting, at-large City Director Dean Kumpuris blasted the city's proposed allocation for downtown Little Rock from the second tranche of federal money for being too small. At the time, Kumpuris said that "to me it is reprehensible that we're gonna spend $31 million on various projects and we think our downtown deserves half a million dollars, and then you're gonna say to people, 'Go raise the rest of the money to do a study.'" Kumpuris and Scott serve as ex officio members of the Downtown Little Rock Partnership's executive board, according to the nonprofit's website.

        Ebony Mitchell has sought the Miss Arkansas crown since her childhood. "Little Eb," as she referred to her younger self, first met Miss Arkansas in 2005 thanks to a Harrison woman who hosts the competition's winner at her home one week every year. Today, Mitchell, 25, speaks clearly and confidently while wearing a glittering crown and sash she won Saturday night at the 2022 Miss Arkansas competition in Little Rock. Eudora Mosby visited Mitchell's school all those years ago. Now, Mosby, alongside Mitchell's mother, and Orean Lencola Sullivan, the first Black woman to win the title, have inspired Mitchell to pursue her lifelong dream of becoming Miss Arkansas. "(My motivation) is the people who have been with me since the beginning, who have always seen something in me, and always pushed me to be the best version of myself," Mitchell said. Mitchell's road to the crown first began when she won the Miss University of Arkansas Princess pageant in 2007. She said that earning the title entered her into the Diamond State Princess/Prince mentorship program, partnering her with that year's Miss U of A. "I thought it was the best thing ever," Mitchell said. "I thought she was the world." Mitchell said participating as a princess, and realizing the organization's impact from a young age, was largely the reason she continued. Since her princess years, Mitchell has been a three-time candidate for Miss Arkansas' Outstanding Teen and has competed at Miss Arkansas every year since 2016. Mitchell also credits seeing her sister compete in pageants as sparking her interest. Rasheen Mitchell, who is two years older, has since realized she enjoys being in the audience cheering for her sister, but before this, they both entered pageants, sometimes together. Ebony Mitchell said one year both sisters ran for the Miss Arkansas' Outstanding Teen title. Rasheen Mitchell said through the years her sister has competed for Miss Arkansas, and despite all her sister's success, she has remained the same Ebony she knows and loves. She said her sister will be the Miss Arkansas that shows young people across the state that "you can be whatever you want to be as long as you put your mind to it." "Watching Ebony, and seeing all the hard work she's actually put into this, and the dedication she has for this," she said. "It's just really nice to see something come full circle when you've worked so hard for it." During her five appearances at Miss Arkansas, Mitchell has held the Miss North Central Arkansas, Miss Central Arkansas, Miss University of Central Arkansas, Miss Metro and Miss Dogwood titles. Mitchell said she believed 2021 would be her last year, and having never been a finalist, she said she was happy to receive first runner-up. Then, the organization announced a change to eligibility rules which allowed Mitchell another chance. "I had another year to compete, and hopefully be Miss Arkansas, so I jumped on it as soon as I could," Mitchell said. "I knew that this was where I was meant to be and that this was the plan for me all along." Mitchell said she's always enjoyed performing onstage, starting dance lessons at four years old and later finding a home in competitive cheerleading. Yet, she found the interview portion of the competition to be challenging. As someone born with an introverted personality, Mitchell said it's been valuable to grow up in an organization which helped her refine conversational skills. She also said she's proud of her ability to walk into a room and speak to anyone she meets. As Miss Arkansas, Mitchell will further her social impact initiative, "A Responsible Digital You," which aims to keep Arkansas children safe online. During the year, she will travel around the Natural State visiting as many schools as possible to raise awareness of internet dangers. Mitchell said she is going to be there for "absolutely everyone" and will make sure everyone she meets feels important. "I want to give back to every person I come in contact with," Mitchell said. "(I want) to tell them to reach for the stars because your dreams are definitely possible." Aside from winning the Miss Arkansas crown, Mitchell said her proudest accomplishment came in graduating with her bachelor's degree in business administration from University of Central Arkansas in 2019. A first generation college student, she said if she could relive one day of her life, she would pick her graduation day. Currently, Mitchell is a graduate student at John Brown University and works as a marketing specialist at Conway Regional Health Systems. As a volunteer at Arkansas Children's Hospital, she realized she had an interest in working for a nonprofit health organization, and she knew business was an area in which she could excel. With her Miss Arkansas scholarship money, Mitchell hopes to follow her passion of teaching, pursuing a doctorate in business so she can become a professor at a university. To Mitchell, the Miss Arkansas Scholarship Competition means "everything." She shared experiences from forming a "special bond" with her Miss Arkansas candidates to meeting the organization's sponsors, who "want to help you have the best year ever, regardless if you're Miss Arkansas or not." As a former participant in the mentorship program, she also said she values the connections she's made with her princesses. "It's paid for my education. It's given me lifelong connections," Mitchell said. "There are girls that I've met through this organization that I will be friends with for the rest of my life."

        A hearing this week could decide whether evidence from one of the most high profile murder cases in Arkansas history can be retested for genetic material in hopes it reveals who killed three children nearly 30 years ago near West Memphis. Attorneys for Damien Echols, one of the West Memphis Three, will appear in court Thursday in Crittenden County for a hearing where they will seek access to evidence from the crime scene where three 8-year-old boys were found brutally murdered in a drainage ditch near West Memphis in 1993. Echols, along with Jason Baldwin and Jessie Misskelley, were convicted in 1994 for the killings, spending years in prison until they were granted immediate freedom under a deal known as an Alford Plea, which permitted Echols, Baldwin and Misskelley to maintain their innocence yet plead guilty in exchange for 18-year-sentences and credit for time served. Echols, his wife Lori Davis, who he met while incarcerated, as well as Baldwin are expected to attend the 9:30 a.m. hearing, Lonnie Soury, an adviser, said Friday morning. The West Memphis Three were released in August 2011. They have been working to clear their names since. No DNA evidence ever linked them to the slayings. Lawyers contend that more advanced genetic testing equipment might detect fragments of DNA that were not detectable when evidence was first examined in the early '90s. This week's court date comes "after two years of lies, unnecessary delay and obfuscation by some Arkansas legal authorities that prevents the West Memphis Three's Damien Echols from conducting state-of-the-art DNA testing on the evidence in the murder of three children in 1993," a May news release from Echols' legal team said. For two years, Echols' attorneys say they have been trying to access evidence from the crime scene, including ligatures used to hogtie the boys as well as articles of clothing. They hope more sophisticated genetic testing technology might unveil DNA from the true perpetrator. Their quest to see what evidence remained nearly met a dead-end after an interview published last April on the news website Talk Business & Politics with Keith Chrestman, prosecuting attorney for the Second Judicial District, which includes Crittenden County where West Memphis is located. In that interview, Chrestman confirmed the evidence might no longer exist. That turned out to not be the case after Little Rock attorney Patrick Benca, who represents Echols, visited the West Memphis Police Department in December and found much of the exhibits from the crime scene to still be catalogued there. "We are pleased that the evidence is intact," Benca said in the news release. "We are planning to move ahead and test this evidence using the latest DNA technology available to hopefully identify the real killer(s) of the three children in 1993 and exonerate Damien Echols, Jason Baldwin and Jessie Misskelley."

        The Little Rock Police Department has removed a recently installed crane lift-style camera from an area across from the only provider of surgical abortions in the state. The Police Department had installed the camera on May 27 near the Little Rock Family Planning Services building, which faces consistent pushback from anti-abortion protesters who work to intimidate patients upon arrival. The police installed the camera by direction of the Northwest patrol division, said Sgt. Eric Barnes, a spokesman for the police department. He added that it was not requested by a specific party. The department said it continues to monitor the need for patrol and surveillance in certain locations given a potential ruling on Roe v. Wade from the U.S. Supreme Court in the near future. Roe v. Wade is the name of the lawsuit that led to the landmark 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision establishing a constitutional right to abortion in the United States. The majority opinion found an absolute right to abortion during the first trimester of pregnancy. Last month, a leaked draft of the U.S. Supreme Court decision suggests the country's highest court could be poised to overturn the constitutional right to abortion, allowing individual states to more heavily regulate or even ban the procedure. Barnes said the placement of the camera near the Little Rock clinic came after a decision made by the department's assumption that criminal behavior in the area might increase following the leaked draft and forthcoming decision on Roe v. Wade. "Obviously, with the national events involving abortion and particularly the topic being propelled into the spotlight with the potential leaked document of the Supreme Court, it was [the department's] opinion that this would help to deter any criminal behavior or problems from anyone that may be looking down with ill will. Essentially, it was placed as a deterrent," Barnes said. Staff at the clinic said they are working daily to communicate with patients and prepare them for what they can expect upon arrival and the possibility of incidents with protesters. "There have been increasing threats and violence to abortion providers around the country, so we are definitely concerned about the safety of our staff and our patients," clinic director Laurie Williams said. Law enforcement officers have been called to the area in the past for issues involving conflicts between patients and protesters. "We've had calls for services [there] before. And, given any potential legal changes surrounding [abortions], we'll definitely provide extra patrol," Barnes said. Williams acknowledged that some patients might be uncomfortable with the presence of police and the camera, but the clinic is appreciative of their presence and concern for safety. "We are happy for the LRPD presence, but we do realize that some people feel intimidated by [their] presence. We try and talk to our patients about what they can expect when coming here. Our protesters are also very intimidating, so safety is our goal," Williams said. The Arkansas Abortion Support Network works to provide comfort to patients through their "Arkansas Clinic Escorts" volunteer program. Volunteers work in rotating shifts to escort patients into the clinic to avoid incidents with protesters. Police cameras are moved around the city at random intervals. On Sunday, it was unclear if the camera will make a return in the coming weeks.  Print Headline: Camera near Little Rock abortion clinic pulled

         BELLA VISTA -- Jason Long is hoping to retire as the gold medal holder in the bench press. He's planning to attend his last meet this summer when the games begin July 7. Long first took part in the National Veterans Wheelchair Games in 2017. He won his first gold in bench press that year. He returned in 2018 and 2019 and brought home two more golds. Each year, he also won a variety of silver and bronze medals in sports ranging from bocce ball to a variety of track events. He was training for the games in early 2020, but like many other events, the Wheelchair Games were canceled that year due to covid. In 2021 he was busy having shoulder surgery and couldn't train or compete. So when he arrives in Tempe, Ariz., this summer, he will be coming back from a long absence, but he's ready for the challenge. Long doesn't always use a wheelchair. He works out most mornings at Riordan Hall and uses crutches to get around. He lost a leg due to a medical accident when he was in the Army and is now on disability. For years he traveled regularly to Fort Smith to play on a wheelchair basketball team, and that eventually led him to the Wheelchair Games. Unfortunately, the basketball team disbanded, and he hasn't been able to find another one to join. To make the Wheelchair Games fair, each participant is assigned a rating based on their disability. They are able to contest their rating if they don't agree, Long explained. There are also age categories, but he doesn't plan to ever compete in any of the older categories. "As you age, you can move into masters class, but there aren't as many people, so there is less competition and it's not as much fun," he said. For games like basketball, teams are assigned via computer to give everyone a fair chance. There are always a few athletes at the games that actually play wheelchair basketball competitively so they are spilt up. He will play basketball this year along with softball, bocce ball and track events like javelin, shot put and discus. "If you go you might as well do as many as you can," he said, but, except for basketball, he's careful to avoid sports where he might be injured. He plays bocce ball because it's a safe sport, but even though he doesn't understand all the rules, it's a lot of fun to play, he said. But he's most interested in weightlifting -- specifically, bench press -- since he has those three gold medals in that event. He wants to retire undefeated. He won in 2019 by pressing 200 pounds. In the gym he's pressed as much as 250 pounds, but pressing in the gym is different than in competition. In competition, form is vital. "In competition both arms have to go up at the same time in one fluid motion without moving your leg or arching your back," he said. Each competitor does three lifts and there's some strategy involved, he explained. To win, a competitor only needs to press five pounds more than the previous competitor. A competitor needs to pay attention to what other people are doing. Each year he trains specifically for the games, and it's a lot of work. He also has to watch his diet to make sure he's in the best weight class. Each year he promises that he will continue to work out, but he won't train for the Wheelchair Games again. But then the next year comes around ... .  Print Headline: Long ready to defend championship

         100 years ago June 20, 1922 "Gray Spot" and "J.B.", the 11-year-old son of Mr. and Mrs. T. A. White ... were honor guests at the White home yesterday. Gray Spot is just an ordinary white "tramp" dog, as J.B. calls him, and made friends with the lad and his two younger brothers. ... While talking to a friend about half way across Rock Island Bridge, Mr. White noticed three boys wading in the water's edge at the foot of the bridge on the North Little Rock side of the Arkansas River Sunday afternoon about 5 o'clock. One of the three suddenly jumped into a place he thought was shallow water from the dike, where the boys had been wading. He went under the water, but not until he caught a glimpse of Gray Spot did Mr. White realize that the boys were his own. ... Realizing the danger to the boy, he called to J.B. ... Worth, the 8-year-old son, had followed his baby brother into the water by this time, although neither could swim. ... J.B. dove into the water after his two brothers, and with difficulty, made his way to water shallow enough to wade, with the two clinging to his arm. 50 years ago June 20, 1972 FAYETTEVILLE -- The police were investigating the possibility of arson Monday in connection with a fire that destroyed or damaged an estimated 240,000 shirts stored in a Mar-Bax Co. warehouse near Fayetteville Sunday night. Mar-Bax is a production arm of the Capital Mercury Shirt Company of New York. The loss was reported to be insured. Officers said it appeared that some kind of flammable liquid had been poured on the first floor. Several containers were on a loading dock and at the back of the building, the police said. 25 years ago June 20, 1997 PINE BLUFF -- Sparks from a cutting torch caused a fire that destroyed the Townsend Park Elementary School Wednesday afternoon, Fire Marshal David Parsley said Thursday. A worker using a torch to remove windows on the east wing of the school at 2601 Fluker St. ignited some wooden casings that surrounded windows. The flames quickly spread to the attic and soon swallowed the building, Parsley said. No charges will be brought against the worker. "It was just an accidental fire," Parsley said. The loss of U-shaped complex was valued at $1.5 million. 10 years ago June 20, 2012 BENTONVILLE -- A former administrative assistant in the Benton County clerk's office pleaded innocent Monday to stealing $48,077 from the office. Christine Southard, 41, of Bella Vista was fired April 30 when state auditors discovered account discrepancies during an annual audit. Southard is accused of writing two $1,200 checks on an office account and stealing cash from bank deposits she made for the office, according to court documents. She had worked in the office since 1999. An affidavit states Southard admitted she took money during an April conversation with County Clerk Tena O'Brien.  Print Headline: Other days

         HOT SPRINGS -- After the Webb Center received a $2,000 grant from the Wagner Foundation, a partnership they formed with Ouachita Children's Center and the Garland County Master Gardeners led to a vegetable garden project behind the OCC building. "It was indicated to us that the OCC needed some vegetable boxes down here," said James B. Moore Jr., who has been a master gardener since 2012 and serves as a board member at the Webb Center. "So I got together with some of the ladies and brothers of the Master Gardeners and we decided to come down and do planter boxes for OCC." The group built four garden beds, adding to the two already established boxes at OCC, and installed an aboveground irrigation system to water the garden. Some of the students helped with the garden beds' installation on Monday, Moore said. The garden is now growing vegetables and fruits including watermelon, pinto beans, peppers, okra, black-eyed peas, and tomatoes as well as marigolds. "Marigolds are designed to attract the good bugs and keep the bad bugs away," Moore said. "When Mr. James came to me with the idea and said that they would like to get the kids out and get them involved, it was a 'Yes' right away," William Wilson, executive director of OCC, said. "And then not only that, the children enjoyed it. They really did. [It] gives them something to do. Quite a few of them asked questions. They were excited about it and that's what matters." "When everything starts growing, we are hoping that they can utilize the food, the black-eyed peas, string beans, pinto beans and tomatoes, to help feed the students here at OCC," Moore said. Not only will the garden provide food, it was also able to provide knowledge and experience for the children at OCC, Wilson said. Jodi Tooke, president of the Master Gardeners, said part of their mission is educating the community about horticulture. "If just two or three remember this day in time and really understand the horticulture part of it, it'll be a blessing to their families and to themselves," Wilson said. "I think there's a lot of benefit to it beyond just their learning about gardening,"said. "We, of course, want to encourage that so that young people will carry on the tradition of gardening and get from it what we get: that sense of accomplishment, that sense of peace, of unity with nature." The Master Gardeners participate in about 16 community service projects throughout Garland County, Tooke said. With about 200 members in the county, each Master Gardener receives 40 hours of initial training and horticulture practices from the University of Arkansas followed by 20 hours of community service each year. Moore said he hoped the Master Gardeners would have the chance to return later in the year and plant fall and winter garden vegetables including lettuce, radishes and cabbage, noting it's possible the garden will expand someday by adding even more garden beds.

         HOT SPRINGS -- For the first time since the covid-19 pandemic began, the Hot Springs Area Cultural Alliance will host an in-person quarterly networking meeting July 11 from 5:30-7:30 p.m. "I think it was prior to the pandemic," the executive director of the HSACA, Mary Zunick, told The Sentinel-Record about the last time the alliance met in person. "I think it was probably at the very beginning of 2020." The reinstatement of in-person quarterly networking meetings offers the arts community opportunities to gather, network and discuss upcoming events or opportunities, a news release from the HSACA stated. "As you might recall for Arts & the Park, in 2020 and 2021, we were almost all outside, so we tried to be very cautious and follow CDC guidelines," Zunick said. "But this year for 2022, after Arts & the Park in May, we decided that we would go ahead and proceed and resume with the quarterly networking meetings." The HSACA plans to use the July meeting to announce the theme for the 2023 Arts & the Park festival. It will also "take place shortly before the 33rd anniversary of Hot Springs' Gallery Walk," giving members a chance to prepare for the celebration, the release said. The alliance hosted a few meetings online through Zoom over the last two years, but "they just weren't as well-attended as the in-person meetings," Zunick added. The HSACA's mission is "to celebrate, advocate and promote the arts and culture of our area," she said. "Part of that is being able to gather together and share information about what's going on with individual artists or arts organizations. And being able to communicate in person just helps bind our arts community together." The meeting will take place in The Warehouse, 301 Broadway St., "donated" by Gefer Sims, who owns The Warehouse and Esther's Gallery & Gifts, the release said. The upcoming meeting is open to interested members of the community and free to attend. "  Print Headline: Cultural alliance plans to resume networking

         BELLA VISTA -- For the fourth year in a row the trio of Jason Ahten, Casey Clary and Derek Warren teamed up to help support the cause of the Cancer Challenge and bust up some clay pigeons in the process. They were one of the many three-person teams to compete in the trap shooting portion of the challenge, held recently in Bella Vista. "We're with Walmart Environmental Safety out of the home office and we represent supply chain and home office both," said Clary. "We basically reach out and say, 'This is a cancer charity event going on for Northwest Arkansas families affected by cancer,' and we reach out to our fellow employees to see who's interested in participating. This year we had four teams representing Walmart." The competition took place at the Bella Vista Property Owners Association's gun range and was divided into a morning division and afternoon division. Teams tried to reach a max score of 300. "If we place first or second we take home a plaque with an engraved clay pigeon and some [shotgun] shells on it," Clary said. But while breaking up clay pigeons made for a fun competition, it was easy to tell the day was about more than shooting. "It gives us a really good opportunity to come out and represent Walmart and get involved in the community," he said. "It's a fun and exciting way to give back and try to give some money back to those families in need and affected by cancer. We get to come out and shoot for fun, so it's a great way to represent the company, give back and have fun while we do it." While Warren and Ahten, both from Bentonville, brought local pride to the team, Clary added a determination to contribute to the cause that showed through his willingness to travel from Sanger, Texas, to be a part of the event. "This is a wonderful event, and we're all happy to be able to help out," he said. "We're spread out a little bit, but we represent EHS across the country. It's a pretty good diverse group we've got this year, and we're all glad to be here."  Print Headline: Walmart trio happy to help Cancer Challenge in Bella Vista

         HOT SPRINGS -- The committee the Hot Springs Police Department formed to bolster recruiting met for the first time last week. Recent recruiting drives haven't turned out applicants in numbers needed to fill 10 to 12 vacancies in the 115 uniformed positions budgeted for 2022, including five partially funded by the U.S. Department of Justice Community Oriented Policing Services grant the city was awarded last year. "We've hit a wall in our recruiting efforts," Police Chief Chris Chapmond told the Civil Service Commission last week. "We are recruiting a younger generation, and, to be honest with you, I don't have the answers any more. "We have put together a good group of young men and women from the civilian and uniformed side. We are going to implement their ideas within the next several weeks. We've got to do something different to reach the men and women of our community." The two-month recruiting drive for the special testing session the commission authorized in March netted 10 applicants, eight of whom took physical and written tests May 21. All eight passed and were interviewed and ranked by the commission. Chapmond said background checks were being conducted and interviews with command staff will be held in a few weeks. He said the background check disqualifies about 90% of applicants. "There's several good candidates," he told the commission. "It's not enough to fill the vacant positions, but I do believe there's some very qualified young men in there." Certified law enforcement officers, or those certified before next June, will receive the $5,000 one-time stipend authorized by Act 224, which the Legislature passed earlier this year. The consent agenda the Hot Springs Board of Directors will consider Tuesday night includes a resolution authorizing the police department to apply for and accept the stipends. Chapmond and Fire Chief Ed Davis gave reports to the commission. Chapmond said two officers placed on administrative leave after the May 12 shooting at the Hot Springs Convention Center returned to work last week. Charles Johnson Jr., 25, was charged with first-degree murder in the death of Michael Jordan, 39, and three counts of first-degree battery in the shooting of three victims who suffered non-life-threatening injuries. According to the probable cause affidavit, Hot Springs police were among the agencies that responded to a fight after the Hot Springs World Class High School graduation. A man later identified as Johnson began shooting as officers were breaking up the fight. "We engaged the suspect and returned fire," Chapmond said. Johnson was treated at a local hospital for multiple gunshot wounds. The department is renewing its accreditation through the Arkansas Association of Chiefs of Police. It was the first AACP-accredited agency. "It's allowed us to review our policies and update them," Chapmond said. "We've reviewed more than 20 and made some sort of changes to update them." The department's new drones have arrived. A budget adjustment the city board adopted in March provided $50,000 for the drone program. Chapmond said the drones will be used to track suspects and at special events and critical incidents. Sean Willits, the department's peer recovery specialist, received an advanced certificate. Chapmond said Willits made 241 contacts last month and sent 18 people to recovery. "Every person we can send to recovery is a potential person we're not dealing with on the street who's fighting an addiction, who's committing a crime to support that addiction," he said. Chapmond said the department seized a large number of fentanyl pills earlier this month. "Those pills could potentially kill any individual that took them," he said of the synthetic opioid linked to numerous overdose deaths. Chapmond is serving on the Arkansas School Safety Commission. He said the panel is meeting three times a week and will present its report to the governor in August. Davis said the fire department is using a cooling trailer to fight heat exhaustion at fire scenes.  Print Headline: Spa City steps up recruiting of police

        A team of AmeriCorps members are spending the summer helping local hunger relief organizations provide fresh produce to those in need. Cobblestone Farms, a nonprofit farm in Fayetteville, received an AmeriCorps grant for a team of 11 volunteers to spend 12 weeks working in Northwest Arkansas, according to Executive Director Kelton Hayes. The farm doesnt need that many corps members working 40 hours a week. So the nonprofit is sharing the workers with organizations that have a similar mission of addressing food insecurity, including the Northwest Arkansas Food Bank, Samaritan Community Center, Appleseeds Teaching Farm, St. James Baptist Church Food Pantry and Mount Comfort Presbyterian Church, he said. Hayes believes in collaboration. “You can go fast alone, but we can go far together,” he said. “We know there is a lot to be done in our community, so why would we not work with any other organization that is either specifically working on food insecurity or wanting to make our community a better place.” Corps team members have divided into groups of two and three and are serving three-week rotations at each organization May 5 through Aug. 5, Hayes said. The corps members are helping organizations during the busiest part of the garden season and providing nonprofits with the staff to expand their operations in some cases, program directors said. The 11 volunteers are taking on tasks ranging from garden chores — such as planting and harvesting vegetables — to helping distribute food. The helpers are part of the National Civilian Community Corps of Americorps. The federally funded program allows 18- to 26-year-old volunteers to spend periods of 10 to 11 months serving in the areas of energy conservation, infrastructure, urban and rural development, and disaster services, according to an AmeriCorps spokesperson. The team serving at Cobblestone Farms is based in Aurora, Colo., and spent its first two 12-week sessions building and restoring homes in Houston to help with recovery from Hurricane Harvey of 2017 and the ice storms of February 2021, said team leader Kara Neal of Great Falls, Mont. Team members serve 1,700 direct hours as well as 80 individual service hours during their months of service, Neal said. All their expenses are paid, and they receive a small stipend while serving, she said. They also receive an education stipend of $6,000 when they complete their term of service, she said. Some team members are fresh out of high school, while others are college students or graduates, she said. Cobblestone Farms has used AmeriCorps volunteers in the past through grants written by the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences and Appleseeds Teaching Farm, Hayes said. This is the first year the farm has taken on the task of writing the grant, he said. While AmeriCorps didnt assign a dollar value to the grant, Hayes estimated corps members will be providing $80,000 worth of labor to the local hunger relief organizations. Cobblestone leases 25 acres off Wedington Drive from New Heights Church at no cost, Hayes said. The nonprofit uses sustainable and organic practices to raise everything from arugula to zucchini in its gardens, as well as sheep, pigs and broiler chickens, he said. The farm plans to produce 25,000 to 30,000 pounds of food this year to be donated to local hunger relief organizations such as the Northwest Arkansas Food Bank, he said. The organization also sells a small portion of its produce through a harvest share program, he said. Locally and sustainably grown food tends to be out of reach for a lot of families, Hayes said. The nonprofit aims to provide access to fresh, local, nutrient-dense food, he said. About 13% of households in Benton, Carroll, Madison and Washington counties were food insecure in 2019, according to Feeding America. The organization defines food insecurity as a lack of consistent access to enough food for every person in a household to live an active, healthy lifestyle. Like Cobblestone Farms, Samaritan Community Center is expanding its garden operation, according to Megan Thomas, garden coordinator. The nonprofit has a garden on one-third of an acre in Rogers that grows organic vegetables, fruits and flowers for its market and cafes in Springdale and Rogers. The markets and cafes provide free food and meals to those in need, she said. The garden produces about 15,000 pounds of organic produce a year, but is moving to a 1.5-acre location on the south side of Rogers, which will allow it to increase the amount of food it grows, expand its reach and provide more educational opportunities, she said. Americorps members are helping Samaritan maintain its current garden so staff can focus on preparing the new site, Thomas said. “Partnering with other nonprofits is great because we all have similar missions, so its really beneficial for us to work together,” she said. Owen Ashley of Beaverton, Ore., joined AmeriCorps when he graduated from high school last year. He said he has enjoyed the volunteer experience and working outside. Assistant team leader Brian Freno of New Jersey graduated with a business degree last year and said he joined the corps to see the country and meet people. “Its been a really good experience,” he said. “Ive gained a lot of skills, a lot of life experience and made a lot of good friends.” The corps members are keeping the food pantry at St. James Missionary Baptist Church in Fayetteville from being understaffed during the summer, according to Monique Jones, director of outreach. The church has a food pantry that feeds about 450 families a week, Jones said. It has a drive-up pantry and delivers food in Springdale, Fayetteville, Farmington, Prairie Grove and Lincoln, she said. It also brings food boxes to all of Fayettevilles public housing projects. Summer is a great time to have extra help because many of the churchs regular volunteers are on vacation, Jones said. Corps members have been helping with tasks such as checking in drive-through clients, data entry, food delivery and cleaning the yard, she said. AmeriCorps members have been helping the Northwest Arkansas Food Bank with its quarter-acre garden on its Springdale campus, according to Haley Deatherage, garden and nutrition manager. The teaching garden is designed to show people how to grow their own healthy organic produce and produce fresh food to distribute, she said.

            <h2>AT&T adding 911 update to phone service; new feature uses GPS in locating wireless callers</h2>

        <font size="4.4" face="arial" color="black">
        AT&T has announced an upgrade to 911 that will make it easier for emergency services to locate wireless phone callers during emergencies in Arkansas. The “Locate Before Route” feature uses device GPS rather than cell towers to identify the location of a 911 call from a mobile phone, said Matt Lawson of AT&T Media Relations. While cell towers could identify a callers location within an area of 10 miles, GPS allows AT&T to identify this location within 50 meters, allowing public safety to respond faster during an emergency, Lawson said. The upgrade, which is only available on the AT&T network, is the first of its kind and now works automatically for wireless 911 calls on the network across the state, he said, and AT&T expects to launch the feature nationwide before the end of June. Juana Green, the 911 director for Little Rock, said she has heard many stories of callers who were near the border of joining jurisdictions at the time of an emergency. She said those calls have the potential to be routed to the wrong public safety answering point, or 911 call center. For example, Green said shes heard on multiple occasions about cell towers routing west Little Rock calls to Pulaski County first, then needing to transfer them to the Little Rock answering point. She said having the 911 call go directly to the correct point initially can improve call answer times. Arkansas 911 Board Executive Director C.J. Engel said in a state which currently has 98 public safety answering points, these transfers happen regularly. Each time a center transfers a call, emergency responders lose seconds or minutes as people re-tell their stories two or three times. Transfers also raise the risk of 911 dialers dropping the call, he said. But with the new technology, Engel believes this will change. “We expect that this capability will reduce the number of 911 transfers and put you to the right place, the majority of the time,” Engel said. While AT&T is currently the only platform to offer location-based routing, Engel said other companies are working on rolling out their own versions of the product. This wont be a problem, Engel said, as those without AT&T wont lose any capabilities with their carriers. They will receive the same 911 service as before, he said. When asked about other carriers, Green similarly said she has no concern that the feature is only available on AT&T. “Its just a matter of time before the others catch on,” she said. However, Engel also added that location-based routing wont “happen automatically,” as Arkansas 911 infrastructure has remained the same for 30 years and is currently undergoing updates needed before location-based routing can function. He said only nine of the states call centers have been upgraded with the necessary Next Generation 911 services, but the 911 Board is working as fast as possible to ensure all call centers can handle the new capability. But AT&T Sales Director Josh Harris, whose team has responsibility for all AT&T retail stories in Arkansas, said AT&Ts location-based routing works with all 911 call centers nationwide, “whether theyre operating under older technology or NextGen 911.” He said there is other location-based routing technology available today that only works with NextGen. He said although its crucial for all call centers to receive those NextGen services as soon as possible, “were not there as an industry.” Harris said AT&T customers will be able to take advantage of the update without having to take any action and that location-based routing is the best solution to improve emergency response times, especially for calls from remote locations. “Weve all heard stories of people who get lost while camping, their cars run off the road, theyre trapped, and they really cant tell 911 operators where they are,” Harris said. “With this location-based routing, call centers can better find your location using GPS on your phone.” According to AT&T, 80% of todays 911 calls are made from mobile devices, meaning the new technology “fills a significant need.” Additionally, 68% of American adults live in homes without landlines, a 2021 study by the National Center for Health Statistics found. When AT&T and the Federal Communications Commission created the United States 911 system in 1968, however, landlines dominated the telephone market. In response to the “tremendous growth” of mobile 911 calls, AT&T launched the feature to ensure the public continues to have fast and reliable connection to the correct answering point. Now, when AT&T customers call 911 from a mobile phone, the network identifies the devices location and routes the call to nearest call center, sending first responders to the scene faster than before. Harris said AT&T has been working on this upgrade for a long time, but only recently did the technology become available. “AT&T jumped all over that technology update,” he said. “That was a very exciting moment for AT&T.”

         FAYETTEVILLE -- A five-story, 422-unit apartment complex would serve as the first major project on empty land that opened for development after the city completed an extension of Van Asche Drive to Arkansas 112 nearly seven years ago. The Subdivision Committee of the Planning Commission on Thursday reviewed a development plan for the apartment complex called Pointe Fayetteville planned on nearly 38 acres southwest of Van Asche Drive and Gregg Avenue. The full commission will review the plan at a later date. The complex would sit back from the intersection, leaving room for future development. The project marks the first phase of a planned six-phase development, according to a letter to city planners from Bryan Moore of DBA Architects in Fayetteville. The entire site planned for development comprises about 389 acres. The proposed structure would be a five-story, wood-framed "wrap" concealing a parking garage in the center that could accommodate 704 cars, the letter says. The building would also house a club, fitness and leasing facility. Tenants would have access to a swimming pool, courtyards and a roof garden, according to the letter. Valet trash service would be available. The letter proposes having 56% of the 422 units as one-bedroom, 40% as two-bedroom and 4% as three-bedroom. The owner and developer behind the project is Keith Richardson of North Little Rock. The land's ownership is listed under Richardson's Riverpointe Development LLC on Washington County property records. The city finished extending Van Asche Drive west to Arkansas 112 in September 2015 using money from a transportation bond issue voters approved in 2006. The project created a widened section of Van Asche with two car lanes in each direction heading east and west and a 5-foot-wide sidewalk on the north and south sides of the road and 10-foot-wide trail on the south side. The Van Asche extension served as a leg of an arterial loop known as the "Mayor's Box" around the central part of the city. The loop goes from where Rupple Road becomes Howard Nickell Road in the northwest part of town, then curves east and becomes Arkansas 112 before transitioning to Van Asche Drive. The rest of the loop takes a short route north along Steele Boulevard and follows Joyce Boulevard east, turning south down Crossover Road and heading back west through Happy Hollow Road and 15th Street. It takes a slight route north on Razorback Road to get to Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard and resumes west until hitting Rupple Road. The final link of the Mayor's Box was completed on Rupple Road in 2020. The Pointe Fayetteville project would extend Roosevelt Avenue from the north and Shiloh Drive from the east with roundabouts to lead traffic into and out of the complex. City planning staff talked about the width of the proposed streets during Thursday's meeting. Blake Jorgensen with Jorgensen and Associates, serving as engineer on the project, said the developers anticipate about 17,000 daily car trips in and out of the site once the rest of the acreage is built out. Jorgensen proposed wider street extensions than city staff suggested to handle the flow of traffic. City planners asked for more details about the full scope of the project. The city is in the middle of designing a railroad crossing at Gregg Avenue and Shiloh Drive to accommodate development. The plan for the apartment complex incorporates that crossing into its design. The project is separate from another nearby planned development. Plans are underway to turn the former Drake Farms site, made up of about 175 acres south of the Fulbright Expressway, into a mixed-use development project. Washington Regional Medical Center bought 15 of the acres for a planned expansion west of its campus. The hospital's plans for the property include facilities for expanded inpatient hospital services, outpatient surgical services, overnight stay capabilities, ambulatory care services and a center for wellness focused on whole-person care, according to a September news release from Washington Regional. A spokeswoman for Washington Regional Medical Center said the hospital does not anticipate the Pointe Fayetteville development having any negative impact for patients, physicians or visitors accessing the campus. "Washington Regional is aware of the proposed development, and we have full confidence the city of Fayetteville will thoroughly review and respond to the proposal in an appropriate manner that ensures the best interest of both city residents and businesses," a statement said.

        The price of a foot of water pipe in Tucson, Arizona: up 19%. The cost of a ton of asphalt in a small Massachusetts town: up 37%. The estimate to build a new airport terminal in Des Moines, Iowa: 69% higher, with a several year delay. Inflation is taking a toll on infrastructure projects across the U.S., driving up costs so much that state and local officials are postponing projects, scaling back others and reprioritizing their needs. The price hikes already are diminishing the value of a $1 trillion infrastructure plan President Joe Biden signed into law just seven months ago. That law had included, among other things, a roughly 25% increase in regular highway program funding for states. “Those dollars are essentially evaporating,” said Jim Tymon, executive director of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials. "The cost of those projects is going up by 20%, by 30%, and just wiping out that increase from the federal government that they were so excited about earlier in the year.” In Casper, Wyoming, the low bid to rebuild a major intersection and construct a new bridge over the North Platte River came in at $35 million this spring — 55% over a state engineer's estimate. The bid was rejected and the project delayed as state officials re-evaluate their options. “If this inflation keeps the way it is, we will have to roll projects from one year into the next, into the next, into the next," said Mark Gillett, chief engineer of the Wyoming Department of Transportation. Gillett had hoped the federal Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act would finance a boom in highway and bridge construction. “But its just not going to go as far as we had hoped,” he said. In addition to roads, the federal infrastructure bill includes billions of dollars for water projects, railways, airports, broadband internet, electric grids and green-energy projects over the coming years. Inflation has affected the entire U.S. economy, posing one of Biden's biggest challenges during a midterm election year. Fuel, food and housing costs all have shot up. Consumer prices surged 8.6% in May over last year, the highest rate since 1981, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. Prices for some key materials in infrastructure construction have risen even more. Prices paid to U.S. manufacturers of asphalt paving and tar mixtures were up 14% in May compared to last year, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Prices for fabricated steel plate, used in bridges, were up 23%, and ductile iron pipes and fittings — used by water systems — were nearly 25% higher. The hikes are being driven by a variety of factors, including worldwide supply-chain backlogs, strong consumer and business spending in the U.S., Russia's invasion of Ukraine — and, some argue, federal energy and fiscal policies. U.S. Rep. Sam Graves, the ranking minority member on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, contends the infrastructure law itself is contributing to inflation by pouring more federal money into an economy already flush with trillions of dollars in federal pandemic aid. “They are borrowing more money so they can spend more money, (which) is driving inflation, which is cutting down on the projects that theyre actually wanting to do,” said Graves, a Missouri Republican who voted against the infrastructure bill. White House senior adviser Mitch Landrieu said the infrastructure law “actually positions us for lowering costs for families in the short- and long-term." He pointed, among other things, to made-in America requirements for steel, iron and other construction materials that could strengthen supply chains and thus lower costs. Officials at Des Moines International Airport were counting on the federal infrastructure money to replace an aging terminal with a modern structure. Four years ago, a new 14-gate terminal was projected to cost about $434 million and be open by 2026. By this spring, the cost had soared to $733 million. Thats more than the airport can afford, even with the federal aid. So officials are planning to break the project into phases, building just five new gates by 2026 at a cost of $411 million. “If inflation continues, it may be a decade before the project gets completely done,” airport Executive Director Kevin Foley said. Other projects also have been rocked by inflationary price hikes. Since voters approved a property tax increase in 2020, the estimated cost of building two light rail lines and a tunnel through Austin, Texas, has gone from $5.8 billion to $10.3 billion. Doubling the tunnel length was a big factor. But inflation and surging real estate prices also fueled the increase, forcing officials to consider cutting costs or lengthening the time frame for completing the project. “Its been a challenge,” said David Couch, chief program officer at the Austin Transit Partnership. Low bids for a series of bridge repairs along Interstate 55 in St. Louis came in at $63 million this year, 57% over the budgeted amount. Overall, Missouris highway construction costs for the fiscal year ending in June were $139 million over budget — an 11% increase that marked a “pretty significant swing” from several under-budget years, said state Department of Transportation Director Patrick McKenna. Though Missouri forged ahead with this year's projects, inflation “will take a bite out of the future,” McKenna said. Inflation has carried more immediate consequence in some places. When bids for a road project in Lansing, Michigan, came in 60% above estimates, the city rebid the project and cut its scope in half, said Andrew Kilpatrick, public service director and acting city engineer. In Huntington, Massachusetts, a 1.5-mile stretch of road won't be finished this year after a 37% spike in the price of liquid asphalt increased the cost for paving a mile to about $140,000. The town gets $159,000 annually in state funding for its roads, highway superintendent Charles Dazelle said. “Right now, one mile of road, thats one year. That is doing nothing else,” Dazelle said. Public water systems across the country also are straining under inflation. When Tucson, Arizona, launched the first part of a four-phase water main replacement project in September 2020, ductile iron pipe cost $75-a-foot and a gate valve cost $3,000. When it bid the most recent phase this spring, pipe costs had risen to nearly $90-a-foot and gate valves to nearly $4,100. The city is now prioritizing what other projects it can afford, and which ones have to wait. “To sum it up, were doing less work for the same amount of money,” said Tucson's chief water engineer, Scott Schladweiler. The city of Tacoma, Washington, also is altering some of its planned water main replacements because of rising costs. “Some of them are getting delayed, some of them are being reduced in scope, and its forcing us to re-evaluate some of the budgets that weve set forth,” said Ali Polda, principal engineer in the city's water department. Residents in a neighborhood west of Little Rock, Arkansas, will pay a $146 monthly surcharge to Central Arkansas Water to install new water lines. The charge is 17% more than originally planned because of spikes in construction costs. Other public utilities also will have to choose between scaling back work and passing along costs to customers, said Michael Arceneaux, acting CEO of the Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies. “In the end, its going to be the rate payers that suffer,” he said, "because the projects have to get done, and funding will have to come from the rate payers.”

        Despite Saturday's humid heat, the Juneteenth festivities on West Ninth Street had the biggest turnout Key Fletcher has seen, she said. Fletcher is the director of the Mosaic Templars Cultural Center, which coordinated many of Saturday's events throughout Little Rock as part of Juneteenth in Da Rock, in honor of the holiday that African Americans have celebrated for decades, even though it was not declared a federal holiday until 2021. Juneteenth marks the date -- June 19, 1865 -- that Union soldiers landed at Galveston, Texas, with news that the Civil War had ended and that enslaved people in that state were officially free. The holiday is still a celebration of freedom, said Erica O'Neal, a Little Rock businesswoman who sold jewelry and handbags at the corner of Ninth and Gaines streets. "Freedom to celebrate who you are, freedom to celebrate your struggles, freedom to celebrate your accomplishments and achievements," O'Neal said. "It's freedom to be you. It really makes me feel good to see so many people out here celebrating." West Ninth Street was the hub of a thriving Little Rock Black business district throughout much of the 20th century, so the three blocks between Broadway and State Street played host to a wide range of food, art, clothing and other vendors Saturday. Fletcher said 130 vendors were present in partnership with the Mosaic Templars, and the Building Black Communities fund provided 40 free vendor booths to grant recipients. Supporting Black artists and entrepreneurs is a high priority for the Mosaic Templars, Fletcher said.  "  Brandi Washington drove in from Hot Springs to set up a booth for her clothing store, The Skirt Shop 101. She said she appreciated the networking opportunity, as well as the ability to "celebrate being free in a safe environment with like minds." Mosaic Templars has held Juneteenth in Da Rock for 13 years, but the past few years have amplified the need to recognize Black history, Fletcher said. "People are looking for a way to recognize the importance and achievements of African Americans," she said. "I think in the past few years we began to see almost a reckoning in our communities [about] the importance of African American history." In addition to the street market, Juneteenth in Da Rock included a 5K race through some of Little Rock's most historic Black neighborhoods, live music and dancing throughout the day at the Main Stage set up on Arch Street, interactive displays at The Hall for children to learn about the history of Juneteenth and a screening of the Arkansas PBS documentary "Dreamland: Little Rock's West 9th Street" at the Ron Robinson Theatre on River Market Avenue. Juneteenth in Da Rock was a largely virtual event in 2020 and 2021 because of the covid-19 pandemic, Fletcher said, and the increased attendance this year might have been a result. The recognition of Juneteenth as a federal holiday last year might have also fueled the celebrations this year, she said. "We've never needed anybody to tell us that our history is important, but we need legislation so that people don't forget," she said. DeMonica McClurge's teenage daughter thought Juneteenth was a celebration of Martin Luther King Jr., so McClurge decided they needed to drive to Little Rock from Sherwood on Saturday as both a fun and educational outing, she said. McClurge had never celebrated the holiday before, and she said it felt "like celebrating the 4th of July from here until the 4th of July." "It's a celebration of my ancestors and who they were and where we've come," she said. Little Rock saw other festivities Saturday independently of Juneteenth in Da Rock. The Arkansas Martin Luther King Jr. Commission held a gathering on the state Capitol steps Saturday morning, featuring a keynote speech from Broadway Joe Booker of radio station KIPR-FM, 92.3, "Power 92." Just before Booker started his speech, police ordered attendees to evacuate the Capitol premises due to an apparent bomb threat. The event resumed a few minutes later at the intersection of Capitol Avenue and Woodlane Street. Little Rock police got several calls reporting threats in different parts of the city Saturday, department spokesman Sgt. Eric Barnes said, but officers checked each scene and did not discover any explosives or other threats. Furthermore, none of the reports indicated the threat was directly related to a Juneteenth celebration. Police traced many of the calls to a woman in North Little Rock who suffers from mental health issues and has made false reports with police before, Barnes said. North Little Rock police were alerted of the false reports and are looking into providing mental health care for the woman through a social worker, he said. When Booker was able to start his speech, he recounted the difficulties of getting the information about the end of slavery to Galveston, Texas, since some Confederate soldiers refused to surrender after the Civil War ended. "As African Americans, I don't think a lot of us think of the 4th of July as our freedom day," he said. The Arkansas Martin Luther King Jr. Commission is a division of the Arkansas Department of Education meant to promote the legacy of the civil rights icon. The commission values the involvement of young people in its cause and in Saturday's event, which included singing and dancing, commission Executive Director DuShun Scarbrough said. "It's important to teach them the reason we celebrate Juneteenth, as opposed to just celebrating it," he said. "I find it important to empower youth to be change agents." Doris McPhee Jackson brought her two teenage nieces to the Capitol for their first Juneteenth celebration to teach them the meaning of the holiday, she said. She has lived in Little Rock since 1983 and watched local Juneteenth celebrations grow over time, she said. "Everybody can participate in Juneteenth," McPhee Jackson said. "Everybody has a part of history in Juneteenth and that's how I see it. As we do it year after year, it gets bigger, and we get more diverse communities coming together." Information for this report was contributed by Grant Lancaster of the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette.  Print Headline: Organizer: Biggest Juneteenth yet

        Without a vote to spare, state Department of Transformation and Shared Services Secretary Amy Fecher was hired by the trustees of the Arkansas Public Employees Retirement System as its new executive director earlier this month, system records show. Seven trustees voted for Fecher's appointment, while four trustees voted against her appointment and two trustees abstained, the system's records revealed in a response to the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette's request under the Arkansas Freedom of Information Act for any correspondence relating to the trustees' votes on June 1 to hire Fecher. The trustees voted to hire Fecher in a voice vote to lead state government's second-largest retirement system, which has more than $10 billion in investments and more than 75,000 working and retired members. She will start work on July 1 with a starting salary of $165,396 a year. In interviews after the divided vote, two trustees said they voted against Fecher because she lacked a financial degree. Another trustee said he voted against her because he favored another candidate with investment experience. Fecher was selected over state treasurer's office Senior Investment Manager Steve Pulley; the retirement system's Chief Investment Officer Carlos Borromeo; and retired Fredericksburg, Texas, City Manager Kent Myers, who is a former Hot Springs city manager. At least a few trustees could be heard during the June 1 meeting dissenting from the vote to hire Fecher. But it wasn't clear how many trustees dissented because none of the trustees asked for a roll call vote and board Chairwoman Candace Franks didn't ask if any trustees abstained from the vote before they departed from the meeting. In a text to Pulley on June 2, Arkansas Municipal League Executive Director Mark Hayes wrote "I tried to push you through, but i think it came down to politics like [Duncan] Baird's appointment. "You'd have been perfect. The system stinks sometimes," Hayes wrote in his text to Pulley obtained by this newspaper under the Arkansas Freedom of Information Act. Trustee Larry Walther, secretary of the state Department of Finance and Administration, declined to comment about the text, said Scott Hardin, a finance department spokesman. In 2019, the system's trustees hired then-state budget administrator Duncan Baird as executive director in a voice vote with no dissenters. Trustees selected Baird over actuary Jody Carreiro and Borromeo. Baird's predecessor, Gail Stone, served as the system's executive director from July 1, 2001 until Dec. 31, 2018. Baird, who is a former Republican state representative from Lowell, departed the system on April 9 to begin work as senior manager of benefit services at Walmart where he is responsible for administering Walmart's 401 (k) plan. According to system records provided by interim system director Allison Woods in response to the Arkansas Freedom of Information Act request, the seven trustees who voted to select Fecher were: Workers Compensation Commission Chairman Dale Douthit. State Department of Labor and Licensing Secretary Daryl Bassett. Sebastian County Judge David Hudson. Van Buren Mayor Joe Hurst. Retired state House assistant coordinator/assistant to the House speaker Kaye Donham. Walther. Retired Alma Police Chief Russell White, who is the chief of police at the Northwest Arkansas National Airport. Douthit, Bassett, Hudson, Hurst and Walther are each appointees of Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson. White and Donham were both appointed by House Speaker Matthew Shepherd, R-El Dorado. According to the records provided by Woods, the four trustees who voted against selecting Fecher included: State Auditor Andrea Lea, a Republican from Russellville Retired Bureau of Legislative Research assistant director of research Richard Wilson. Retired Arkansas Game and Fish Commission law enforcement corporal Gary Wallace. Hot Springs City Engineer Gary Carnahan. Wilson and Wallace are both appointees of Senate President Pro Tempore Jimmy Hickey, R-Texarkana. Carnahan is an appointee of Hutchinson. As state auditor, Lea serves on the system's board under state law. Trustee Jason Brady, who is chief deputy state treasurer for operations, and Franks, who is the state's retired bank commissioner, both abstained from the vote, according to the records provided by Woods. Brady serves on the board as the representative of Republican state Treasurer Dennis Milligan of Benton. The state treasurer serves on the board under state law. Earlier this month, Brady said that he abstained from voting on hiring Fecher because one of the treasurer's office employees was a candidate for executive director. Franks, who is an appointee of Hutchinson, said last week that she typically doesn't vote as the board's chairman unless she has to vote to break a tie, but "I think the board made a good decision." After the trustees selected Fecher, Hutchinson said earlier this month that "This was a decision made by the board independently and I applaud their diligence in the selection process." On Thursday, Hickey said Thursday that he didn't indicate his preference for either Wallace or Wilson. Asked about the trustees' selection of Fecher, Hickey, who is among her legislative critics, said Thursday, "I don't have any comment." Shepherd said Thursday in a written statement that "I did not contact any of my appointees to the APERS Board of Trustees regarding the Executive Director position. "As with the many actions of our boards and commissions, I trust members make decisions in the best interest of the state of Arkansas," Shepherd said. JOB DESCRIPTION Fecher, who has a bachelor's degree in physical science from the University of Central Arkansas, has been secretary of the state Department of Transformation and Shared Services since 2019. She also served as the state's chief transformation officer from 2016-2019, executive vice president for the Arkansas Economic Development Commission from 2015-2019 and director of the Department of Rural Services in 2015 under Hutchinson, according to her resume. She worked as assistant director in Gov. Mike Huckabee's office from 2000-2001, deputy director of the Department of Rural Services from 2001-2005 and as legislative consultant and liaison for state officials for the Hutchinson Group consulting firm from 2005-2007, her resume states. The job description for the retirement system executive director post calls for minimum education and/or experience that includes a bachelor's degree in business administration, accounting, finance, economics, public administration or a related field and five years of executive experience reporting directly to corporate or public leadership, including three years in a supervisory or managerial capacity. Woods said in an email dated April 22 to the five trustees on the selection committee that if any of the 21 applicants for the job did not meet at least one component of the three components of the minimum requirements, they would be determined to not have met the overall minimum requirements. "For the degree requirement, which mentions a related field, we accepted any field of study as long as they had earned a degree," she said. Acting as a spokesman for Walther, who served as chairman of the trustees' selection committee, Hardin said Thursday in a written statement that "The decision by APERS staff to allow any bachelor's degree to proceed (in combination with the other requirements) provided the selection committee the discretion to determine whether a degree was within a related field as there was not a formal list of related degrees. "While a bachelor's degree may be required for positions throughout state government, it is not uncommon for hiring officials to have discretion regarding the type of degree," he said. Hardin said that Walther indicated that nine applicants were determined to meet requirements based on information provided to him by the system's staff, and the selection committee on April 28 chose four candidates for an interview. The selection committee include Walther, Bassett, Carnahan, Wilson and Lea. Earlier this month, Wilson said he voted against hiring Fecher because "we had a disagreement on a technical issue. "Amy meets a lot of requirements. We all know that," he said. But Wilson said that "the way that they were written there was a disagreement" about whether the bachelor's degree needs to be in business administration, accounting, finance, economics, public administration or a related field. Lea said earlier this month that she voted against selecting Fecher because Fecher's bachelor's degree "is in science and not finance and the other candidates all had financial backgrounds and degrees." But Carnahan said last week that "to me, that was not a hardline rule" for the executive director to have a bachelor's degree in a finance-related field. While he said he voted against hiring Fecher as the system's executive director, he said that "I was really voting for one of the other candidates," whom he declined to identify. "She is very strong in having a good understanding of working with the legislative process, and the governor's office and and also managed government agencies," Carnahan aid. "We are all 110 % behind her and will do everything we can to work with her." White said he voted to select Fecher as the system's executive director because he felt like she was the best choice for the position. He said Fecher -- who has experience in dealing with lawmakers regarding legislation and will reach out to the system's members at town hall meetings -- and one of the candidates with financial investment experience, whom he declined to identify, had the best interviews for the job. Borromeo already provides "really good financial leadership for the system," White said. White said lobbyist Rett Hatcher, a former aide to Hutchinson, endorsed Fecher as the best candidate for the system's executive director job. "Nobody said the governor wanted her for the job."

        Ebony Mitchell, a 25-year-old graduate student from Harrison, took the Miss Arkansas 2022 title on Saturday night in Little Rock. The outgoing Miss Arkansas, Whitney Williams, crowned Mitchell as she received a bouquet of red roses, confetti fell and the other 40 candidates rushed to congratulate her onstage at Robinson Center. “A Responsible Digital You” is Mitchells social impact initiative, the cause she will further during her year as Miss Arkansas. “Its all about being safe online and teaching Arkansas children, especially, how to be safe,” Mitchell said. Mitchell won the Miss Dogwood pageant in November to qualify for the state competition. She had also competed at Miss Arkansas 2021 and finished as the first runner-up to Williams. She is a 2019 graduate of University of Central Arkansas and is currently pursuing a Masters of Business Administration with an emphasis in Health Administration from John Brown University. The maximum age for Miss Arkansas candidates is 24. However, the would-be candidates for the 2020 competition, which was postponed because of covid-19, received an extra year of eligibility. After this year, Mitchell said she would have aged out of the scholarship competition, and she hopes her legacy as Miss Arkansas will be one of grace, impact and resilience. “I want people to remember me as the Miss Arkansas that provided everyone with a smile, that could talk to anyone and that can make anyone feel like they are valued, capable and seen,” she said. The 10 finalists, named at the beginning of the Saturday finals, competed in onstage question, talent and evening wear segments throughout the night. Mitchell answered a question from Miss Steel Capital, Piper Stallings, during the onstage interview portion. When asked her thoughts on “cancel culture,” she said she doesnt believe that by making mistakes, a person should be “canceled forever.” “I believe in forgiveness, and I believe in giving second chances,” Mitchell said. “I would love to see cancel culture come to an end in our lifetime.” During the talent or artistic expression segment, candidates showed their skills ranging from playing the fiddle to acrobatic jazz. Mitchell competed with an energetic tap dance to Aretha Franklins “Respect,” including elements of gymnastics that received applause from the packed crowd. As she finished her dance performance, friends and family members cheered and held up signs with her face. The Miss Arkansas Scholarship Foundation is the nonprofit organization which raises funds for the competition. As the next Miss Arkansas, Mitchell will receive a $30,000 scholarship. The foundation awarded every Miss Arkansas candidate $400. In total, this years competition awarded $167,300 in scholarships. Coming from a single-mother home, Mitchell said she once believed it would be impossible for her to attend college. She said her participation in the scholarship competition over the years has allowed her to pursue both her bachelors and masters degrees. Mitchell will compete at the Miss America pageant in Connecticut in December. Three Miss Arkansas title holders have won the national competition. Most recently, Savvy Shields Wolfe won the title in 2016. Sydney Wendfeldt, a 26-year-old from Mountain Home, was the Miss Arkansas 2022 first runner-up.   Gallery: Miss Arkansas 2022

        OMAHA -- The Arkansas Razorback Foundation and the Alumni Association hosted a pregame brunch for their members at DJ's Dugout Sports Bar and Grill just blocks from Charles Schwab Stadium where the Razorback played their first game of the College World Series. A large inflated Razorback marked the entrance to the large restaurant, which had about 350 guests in attendance. Once inside, they were able to select from an array of free Razorback souvenirs including pom-poms, T-shirts, sunglasses and bottles of sun screen for the 93-degree afternoon game.  John Nabors and Justin Acri with the radio station 103.7 The Buzz were on site and broadcast a pregame show from the restaurant, and Big Red -- the Razorback mascot -- led the entire restaurant in calling the Hogs. The Razorbacks beat Stanford in their opening-round game 17-2. The team will continue on in the winner's bracket of the double-elimination tournament, and will face SEC foe on Monday.   Gallery: Arkansas Fans in Omaha  Print Headline: Razorback groups meet in Nebraska

        The upswing of covid-19 cases in Arkansas continued Saturday with 708 new recorded cases of the virus, 98 more than the previous Saturday's increase, according to data from the Arkansas Department of Health. The state added 4,963 new cases and 1,926 active, or currently infectious, cases in the past week. Active cases jumped 358 to 8,491 on Saturday after crossing 8,000 on Friday for the first time since Feb. 23, according to the data. However, no new deaths from covid-19 were reported for the third day in a row, keeping the death toll at 11,533. The Health Department recorded 16 new deaths of the virus in the past week. The number of Arkansans hospitalized with covid-19 dropped Thursday and Friday but rose by eight on Saturday, totaling 189. Even with the decreases, 35 more people were hospitalized Saturday than a week earlier. One person was admitted to intensive care with the virus, bringing the state's total to 27 Saturday, four more than a week earlier. The number of covid-19 patients on ventilators remained at nine for the third day in a row, according to Health Department data.

        The Arkansas Senate Ethics Committee is scheduled to convene on Wednesday and Thursday, after the Senate Rules Committee appointed a temporary replacement for an ethics committee member. Senate Rules Committee Chairman James Sturch, R-Batesville, said Friday that the Senate Rules Committee on Thursday voted to appoint state Sen. David Wallace, R-Leachville, as the temporary replacement for a member of the Senate Ethics Committee. When a complaint is filed against a member of the Senate Ethics Committee, the state Senate's rules require the Senate Rules Committee to appoint a temporary replacement for the ethics committee member until the investigation of the complaint is completed, he said. "They did not disclose who the complaint is filed against to me or members of the Rules Committee," Sturch said in a text message. "We were just told it was a Republican member, therefore we appointed another majority member." Senate President Pro Tempore Jimmy Hickey, R-Texarkana, on Friday declined to comment on the matter. The Senate Ethics Committee's members include Republican Sens. Kim Hammer of Benton, Missy Irvin of Mountain View, Mark Johnson of Ferndale, Mat Pitsch of Fort Smith,and Dan Sullivan of Jonesboro, and Democratic Sens. Joyce Elliott of Little Rock, Stephanie Flowers of Pine Bluff and Clarke Tucker of Little Rock. In response to the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette's public records request seeking the identity of the Senate Ethics Committee member, who has been temporarily replaced, Senate Director/Secretary Ann Cornwell wrote Friday in an email, "It was handled by BLR [the Bureau of Legislative Research]." Hammer, who chairs the Senate Ethics Committee, said Friday in a written statement issued through the Bureau of Legislative Research that a meeting of the Senate Ethics Committee has been scheduled for Wednesday to begin at 9 a.m. in Room 309 in the state Capitol. The committee will take up a matter that has been presented to it under the Senate eules, he said. "To protect the integrity of the process and ensure that the matter is handled appropriately, at this time I am not at liberty to discuss any of the details of the matter," Hammer said. Asked whether he has been temporarily replaced as a member of the Senate Ethics Committee, Johnson said he was advised by legislative staff, on behalf of Hammer, not to answer that question. "Rules are about confidentiality prior to the committee review," he said in a text message. The Senate Ethics Committee also is scheduled to meet Thursday at 9 a.m. in Room 309 in the state Capitol, according to the General Assembly's website. Sen. Alan Clark, R-Lonsdale, on Friday declined to comment when asked about speculation in some state Capitol circles that a complaint has been filed against him with the Senate Ethics Committee. Asked whether the Senate Ethics Committee meetings would be open to the public or closed, Bureau of Legislative Research Director Marty Garrity said, "I would refer you to [Senate] rule 24.09(d) which provides that the public shall be allowed to observe the entire proceeding unless the committee is in executive session." In June of 2018, the state Senate approved an overhaul of its rules to create a committee on ethics, prohibit senators from certain activities involving conflicts of interest, and require more disclosure of other conflicts and their personal finances. The Senate's action came after federal investigations in the previous few years led to convictions of several former state lawmakers.  Print Headline: Temporary member chosen for ethics panel

         SYMONE MEETS VEEP Conway native and Rupaul's Drag Race Season 13 winner Symone got to spend time with Vice President Kamala Harris last week. Harris made a surprise appearance at the Capital Pride Festival in Washington, D.C., on June 12 and was joined onstage by Symone, who shared photos on Instagram of herself with the vice president and husband Douglas Emhoff. "Absolutely blown away y'all," Symone wrote. "I got to meet Kamala Harris and Douglas Emhoff today at the DC Pride. Thank you so much for this moment Madame Vice President and the lovely gifts! I love you DC!" Not only has she been rubbing shoulders with the vice president, Symone has added acting to her resume. She plays an out-of-drag character in "Bros," the gay rom-com feature film from writer-star Billy Eichner. "When I saw Symone, who I think is such a superstar, I thought, I want a place for Symone in 'Bros,'" Eichner told Entertainment Weekly earlier this month. "I was thinking of the roles we had and I didn't know if she'd be interested in playing a character that was out of drag, but I thought, why not use this as an opportunity?" Symone has a small role as an acquaintance of Bobby Leiber, who is played by Eichner, according to Entertainment Weekly. The film, directed by Nicholas Stoller and produced by Stoller and Judd Apatow, is set for release on Sept. 30. REALITY SHOW ARKIES Symone became famous from appearing on a reality show, now two other hopefuls with Arkansas connections are looking for a similar outcome. Scarlett Bentley, who grew up in Batesville and left Arkansas for San Diego, is a junior stewardess on the Parsifal III in season three of Bravo's "Below Deck Sailing Yacht," while Adam Riley of Fayetteville is among the survivalists competing for $500,000 in a remote valley in Labrador, Canada, on History Channel's "Alone." The 36-year-old Riley was 9 when he immigrated with his family to Florida from England, according to the show's page at history.com. After leaving high school and quitting his job as an alligator wrestler -- no, really, that's what it says -- he spent years exploring wild areas all over the world. He now works as a carpenter building custom tree houses in Arkansas. After four episodes, Riley is among eight left from the original 10 contestants still in the running for the $500,000 prize. Bentley was in marketing before working on chartered trips at sea and has two years yachting experience, according to bravotv.com. Drama has ensued since she joined the Parsifal III crew, according to the web site, and her relationship with the first mate could lead to trouble. "Below Deck Sailing Yacht" airs Mondays at 7 p.m. "Alone" airs Thursdays at 8 p.m. email: sclancy@adgnewsroom.com  Print Headline: State puts new stars on screens

         100 years ago June 19, 1922 BATESVILLE -- A company of local business people have bought out the Mack Hardy tailor shop in the Arlington hotel building and in addition to conducting a tailor shop will establish the first manufacturing fur garment shop ever operated in this city. The company will be operated under the name "Fashion Shop," and will manufacture women's furs from the raw pelts to the finished garments. There is an abundance of fur-bearing animals trapped in this section, many of which are valuable. These furs will be bought from the trappers and retail fur dealers, and after being made up will be sold to wholesale and retail merchants. 50 years ago June 19, 1972 JONESBORO -- Herbert Lenual Crabtree, 34, a former postal clerk at Nettleton Substation of the Jonesboro post office, was found innocent by a deferral court jury of five men and seven women here Friday on charges of embezzling $200.
