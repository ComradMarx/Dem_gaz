        The board president of the Downtown Little Rock Partnership in a recent letter to the Little Rock Board of Directors said that much of the city's downtown is in "a state of disrepair," impeding efforts to rebound from the covid-19 pandemic. The letter from Carol Worley asked for an allocation of at least $1 million for downtown Little Rock from the city's latest tranche of American Rescue Plan Act funding. "The struggle to regain our pre-2020 status is real," Worley wrote in the letter dated June 6. "This funding was given to the city to help make a difference in areas of need. Let's take this opportunity to use this money as intended and give the urban core of our capital city the attention it deserves." Members of the city board are expected to vote soon on a plan for how to spend the lion's share of the second and final portion of $18.8 million from the federal government. The covid-19 economic rescue package signed by President Joe Biden in March 2021 included $350 billion in direct aid for non-federal governmental entities like states, counties and cities, including Arkansas' capital. Little Rock's total allocation of more than $37 million was the largest among all the cities in Arkansas receiving aid. The first half was received in May 2021. City board members have heard two initial proposals for how to spend $12.35 million of the latest tranche: one from city staff that Little Rock's intergovernmental relations manager, Emily Jordan Cox, laid out recently, followed by another version from Ward 6 City Director Doris Wright. Cox presented the proposed spending plan to board members on May 31. Wright's spending plan was discussed at a board meeting Tuesday. Her resolution is set to be added to the board's agenda for possible action at this week's meeting, as long as enough of her colleagues vote in favor of the addition. Both plans include money for a downtown master plan and other needs. The version from city staff would allocate $500,000 for downtown capital needs and the master plan, but the Downtown Little Rock Partnership would be required to raise the money for any remaining costs related to the master plan. Wright's version increased the sum for the downtown category to $1.5 million. Following discussions with Wright, Little Rock Mayor Frank Scott Jr. suggested at the most recent city board meeting that officials might try to bring forward another spending proposal that incorporates items city officials can all agree on. Downtown Little Rock has not had a master plan since Ottenheimer Market Hall in the River Market was completed in the early 1990s, according to Worley's letter. "During the pandemic, our downtown, more so than everywhere else, was shut down. Offices were left vacant, restaurants were closed, small businesses discontinued operations and commercial spaces were abandoned," Worley wrote. "As you all know, our downtown is not rebounding from the pandemic like other areas of the city. It is unlikely it will with the current model we have in place." Worley called for "a new path forward" for downtown Little Rock, referring to the need for ideas about rethinking land use as well as "hybrid ideas" for spaces to live and work. "Something that will show us creative repurposing of existing buildings so that they will be functional and accommodating for all types of workers and employers," Worley wrote. "That's why the new master plan is so important." She later wrote, "Our downtown businesses, hotels and restaurants are desperately trying to rebound from the loss of our downtown patrons. Sadly, a lot of our downtown area is in a state of disrepair, which impedes efforts of reactivating the area." Worley suggested that bringing life back to the downtown ought to start at "eye level," and said that at a minimum, officials need to fix broken signs and lighting, repair potholes, repaint crosswalks and address graffiti, among other things. She also argued that sprinkler systems for planters and streetscapes would reduce the manpower currently needed for watering. "Better street lighting would allow for increased safety at night; more effective trash receptacles would help control our littered streets; and fixing the downtown potholes would be an immediately visible benefit to visitors, residents and workers," Worley wrote. A minimum $1 million allocation for downtown Little Rock "would be a good start for many of these items, including the much-needed master plan," Worley wrote. Worley is a local attorney with the firm Worley, Wood & Parrish. In a phone interview Friday, she suggested that the master plan itself would be created by an outside firm and then the Downtown Little Rock Partnership would ideally "be able to help coordinate setting the things in motion to move in the direction of whatever the plan is." She envisioned a separate group of developers and other key downtown players who could help officials focus on what they want with the master plan and assist with writing the request for proposals in order to identify the appropriate company. The Downtown Little Rock Partnership is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization separate from Little Rock's municipal government that nevertheless receives significant funding from the city. The city's 2022 budget approved late last year included an outside-agency allocation of $195,000 for the Downtown Little Rock Partnership in exchange for various services, up from $145,000 in the 2021 budget. During the May 31 board meeting, at-large City Director Dean Kumpuris blasted the city's proposed allocation for downtown Little Rock from the second tranche of federal money for being too small. At the time, Kumpuris said that "to me it is reprehensible that we're gonna spend $31 million on various projects and we think our downtown deserves half a million dollars, and then you're gonna say to people, 'Go raise the rest of the money to do a study.'" Kumpuris and Scott serve as ex officio members of the Downtown Little Rock Partnership's executive board, according to the nonprofit's website.

        Ebony Mitchell has sought the Miss Arkansas crown since her childhood. "Little Eb," as she referred to her younger self, first met Miss Arkansas in 2005 thanks to a Harrison woman who hosts the competition's winner at her home one week every year. Today, Mitchell, 25, speaks clearly and confidently while wearing a glittering crown and sash she won Saturday night at the 2022 Miss Arkansas competition in Little Rock. Eudora Mosby visited Mitchell's school all those years ago. Now, Mosby, alongside Mitchell's mother, and Orean Lencola Sullivan, the first Black woman to win the title, have inspired Mitchell to pursue her lifelong dream of becoming Miss Arkansas. "(My motivation) is the people who have been with me since the beginning, who have always seen something in me, and always pushed me to be the best version of myself," Mitchell said. Mitchell's road to the crown first began when she won the Miss University of Arkansas Princess pageant in 2007. She said that earning the title entered her into the Diamond State Princess/Prince mentorship program, partnering her with that year's Miss U of A. "I thought it was the best thing ever," Mitchell said. "I thought she was the world." Mitchell said participating as a princess, and realizing the organization's impact from a young age, was largely the reason she continued. Since her princess years, Mitchell has been a three-time candidate for Miss Arkansas' Outstanding Teen and has competed at Miss Arkansas every year since 2016. Mitchell also credits seeing her sister compete in pageants as sparking her interest. Rasheen Mitchell, who is two years older, has since realized she enjoys being in the audience cheering for her sister, but before this, they both entered pageants, sometimes together. Ebony Mitchell said one year both sisters ran for the Miss Arkansas' Outstanding Teen title. Rasheen Mitchell said through the years her sister has competed for Miss Arkansas, and despite all her sister's success, she has remained the same Ebony she knows and loves. She said her sister will be the Miss Arkansas that shows young people across the state that "you can be whatever you want to be as long as you put your mind to it." "Watching Ebony, and seeing all the hard work she's actually put into this, and the dedication she has for this," she said. "It's just really nice to see something come full circle when you've worked so hard for it." During her five appearances at Miss Arkansas, Mitchell has held the Miss North Central Arkansas, Miss Central Arkansas, Miss University of Central Arkansas, Miss Metro and Miss Dogwood titles. Mitchell said she believed 2021 would be her last year, and having never been a finalist, she said she was happy to receive first runner-up. Then, the organization announced a change to eligibility rules which allowed Mitchell another chance. "I had another year to compete, and hopefully be Miss Arkansas, so I jumped on it as soon as I could," Mitchell said. "I knew that this was where I was meant to be and that this was the plan for me all along." Mitchell said she's always enjoyed performing onstage, starting dance lessons at four years old and later finding a home in competitive cheerleading. Yet, she found the interview portion of the competition to be challenging. As someone born with an introverted personality, Mitchell said it's been valuable to grow up in an organization which helped her refine conversational skills. She also said she's proud of her ability to walk into a room and speak to anyone she meets. As Miss Arkansas, Mitchell will further her social impact initiative, "A Responsible Digital You," which aims to keep Arkansas children safe online. During the year, she will travel around the Natural State visiting as many schools as possible to raise awareness of internet dangers. Mitchell said she is going to be there for "absolutely everyone" and will make sure everyone she meets feels important. "I want to give back to every person I come in contact with," Mitchell said. "(I want) to tell them to reach for the stars because your dreams are definitely possible." Aside from winning the Miss Arkansas crown, Mitchell said her proudest accomplishment came in graduating with her bachelor's degree in business administration from University of Central Arkansas in 2019. A first generation college student, she said if she could relive one day of her life, she would pick her graduation day. Currently, Mitchell is a graduate student at John Brown University and works as a marketing specialist at Conway Regional Health Systems. As a volunteer at Arkansas Children's Hospital, she realized she had an interest in working for a nonprofit health organization, and she knew business was an area in which she could excel. With her Miss Arkansas scholarship money, Mitchell hopes to follow her passion of teaching, pursuing a doctorate in business so she can become a professor at a university. To Mitchell, the Miss Arkansas Scholarship Competition means "everything." She shared experiences from forming a "special bond" with her Miss Arkansas candidates to meeting the organization's sponsors, who "want to help you have the best year ever, regardless if you're Miss Arkansas or not." As a former participant in the mentorship program, she also said she values the connections she's made with her princesses. "It's paid for my education. It's given me lifelong connections," Mitchell said. "There are girls that I've met through this organization that I will be friends with for the rest of my life."

        A hearing this week could decide whether evidence from one of the most high profile murder cases in Arkansas history can be retested for genetic material in hopes it reveals who killed three children nearly 30 years ago near West Memphis. Attorneys for Damien Echols, one of the West Memphis Three, will appear in court Thursday in Crittenden County for a hearing where they will seek access to evidence from the crime scene where three 8-year-old boys were found brutally murdered in a drainage ditch near West Memphis in 1993. Echols, along with Jason Baldwin and Jessie Misskelley, were convicted in 1994 for the killings, spending years in prison until they were granted immediate freedom under a deal known as an Alford Plea, which permitted Echols, Baldwin and Misskelley to maintain their innocence yet plead guilty in exchange for 18-year-sentences and credit for time served. Echols, his wife Lori Davis, who he met while incarcerated, as well as Baldwin are expected to attend the 9:30 a.m. hearing, Lonnie Soury, an adviser, said Friday morning. The West Memphis Three were released in August 2011. They have been working to clear their names since. No DNA evidence ever linked them to the slayings. Lawyers contend that more advanced genetic testing equipment might detect fragments of DNA that were not detectable when evidence was first examined in the early '90s. This week's court date comes "after two years of lies, unnecessary delay and obfuscation by some Arkansas legal authorities that prevents the West Memphis Three's Damien Echols from conducting state-of-the-art DNA testing on the evidence in the murder of three children in 1993," a May news release from Echols' legal team said. For two years, Echols' attorneys say they have been trying to access evidence from the crime scene, including ligatures used to hogtie the boys as well as articles of clothing. They hope more sophisticated genetic testing technology might unveil DNA from the true perpetrator. Their quest to see what evidence remained nearly met a dead-end after an interview published last April on the news website Talk Business & Politics with Keith Chrestman, prosecuting attorney for the Second Judicial District, which includes Crittenden County where West Memphis is located. In that interview, Chrestman confirmed the evidence might no longer exist. That turned out to not be the case after Little Rock attorney Patrick Benca, who represents Echols, visited the West Memphis Police Department in December and found much of the exhibits from the crime scene to still be catalogued there. "We are pleased that the evidence is intact," Benca said in the news release. "We are planning to move ahead and test this evidence using the latest DNA technology available to hopefully identify the real killer(s) of the three children in 1993 and exonerate Damien Echols, Jason Baldwin and Jessie Misskelley."

        The Little Rock Police Department has removed a recently installed crane lift-style camera from an area across from the only provider of surgical abortions in the state. The Police Department had installed the camera on May 27 near the Little Rock Family Planning Services building, which faces consistent pushback from anti-abortion protesters who work to intimidate patients upon arrival. The police installed the camera by direction of the Northwest patrol division, said Sgt. Eric Barnes, a spokesman for the police department. He added that it was not requested by a specific party. The department said it continues to monitor the need for patrol and surveillance in certain locations given a potential ruling on Roe v. Wade from the U.S. Supreme Court in the near future. Roe v. Wade is the name of the lawsuit that led to the landmark 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision establishing a constitutional right to abortion in the United States. The majority opinion found an absolute right to abortion during the first trimester of pregnancy. Last month, a leaked draft of the U.S. Supreme Court decision suggests the country's highest court could be poised to overturn the constitutional right to abortion, allowing individual states to more heavily regulate or even ban the procedure. Barnes said the placement of the camera near the Little Rock clinic came after a decision made by the department's assumption that criminal behavior in the area might increase following the leaked draft and forthcoming decision on Roe v. Wade. "Obviously, with the national events involving abortion and particularly the topic being propelled into the spotlight with the potential leaked document of the Supreme Court, it was [the department's] opinion that this would help to deter any criminal behavior or problems from anyone that may be looking down with ill will. Essentially, it was placed as a deterrent," Barnes said. Staff at the clinic said they are working daily to communicate with patients and prepare them for what they can expect upon arrival and the possibility of incidents with protesters. "There have been increasing threats and violence to abortion providers around the country, so we are definitely concerned about the safety of our staff and our patients," clinic director Laurie Williams said. Law enforcement officers have been called to the area in the past for issues involving conflicts between patients and protesters. "We've had calls for services [there] before. And, given any potential legal changes surrounding [abortions], we'll definitely provide extra patrol," Barnes said. Williams acknowledged that some patients might be uncomfortable with the presence of police and the camera, but the clinic is appreciative of their presence and concern for safety. "We are happy for the LRPD presence, but we do realize that some people feel intimidated by [their] presence. We try and talk to our patients about what they can expect when coming here. Our protesters are also very intimidating, so safety is our goal," Williams said. The Arkansas Abortion Support Network works to provide comfort to patients through their "Arkansas Clinic Escorts" volunteer program. Volunteers work in rotating shifts to escort patients into the clinic to avoid incidents with protesters. Police cameras are moved around the city at random intervals. On Sunday, it was unclear if the camera will make a return in the coming weeks.  Print Headline: Camera near Little Rock abortion clinic pulled

         100 years ago June 20, 1922 "Gray Spot" and "J.B.", the 11-year-old son of Mr. and Mrs. T. A. White ... were honor guests at the White home yesterday. Gray Spot is just an ordinary white "tramp" dog, as J.B. calls him, and made friends with the lad and his two younger brothers. ... While talking to a friend about half way across Rock Island Bridge, Mr. White noticed three boys wading in the water's edge at the foot of the bridge on the North Little Rock side of the Arkansas River Sunday afternoon about 5 o'clock. One of the three suddenly jumped into a place he thought was shallow water from the dike, where the boys had been wading. He went under the water, but not until he caught a glimpse of Gray Spot did Mr. White realize that the boys were his own. ... Realizing the danger to the boy, he called to J.B. ... Worth, the 8-year-old son, had followed his baby brother into the water by this time, although neither could swim. ... J.B. dove into the water after his two brothers, and with difficulty, made his way to water shallow enough to wade, with the two clinging to his arm. 50 years ago June 20, 1972 FAYETTEVILLE -- The police were investigating the possibility of arson Monday in connection with a fire that destroyed or damaged an estimated 240,000 shirts stored in a Mar-Bax Co. warehouse near Fayetteville Sunday night. Mar-Bax is a production arm of the Capital Mercury Shirt Company of New York. The loss was reported to be insured. Officers said it appeared that some kind of flammable liquid had been poured on the first floor. Several containers were on a loading dock and at the back of the building, the police said. 25 years ago June 20, 1997 PINE BLUFF -- Sparks from a cutting torch caused a fire that destroyed the Townsend Park Elementary School Wednesday afternoon, Fire Marshal David Parsley said Thursday. A worker using a torch to remove windows on the east wing of the school at 2601 Fluker St. ignited some wooden casings that surrounded windows. The flames quickly spread to the attic and soon swallowed the building, Parsley said. No charges will be brought against the worker. "It was just an accidental fire," Parsley said. The loss of U-shaped complex was valued at $1.5 million. 10 years ago June 20, 2012 BENTONVILLE -- A former administrative assistant in the Benton County clerk's office pleaded innocent Monday to stealing $48,077 from the office. Christine Southard, 41, of Bella Vista was fired April 30 when state auditors discovered account discrepancies during an annual audit. Southard is accused of writing two $1,200 checks on an office account and stealing cash from bank deposits she made for the office, according to court documents. She had worked in the office since 1999. An affidavit states Southard admitted she took money during an April conversation with County Clerk Tena O'Brien.  Print Headline: Other days

         HOT SPRINGS -- After the Webb Center received a $2,000 grant from the Wagner Foundation, a partnership they formed with Ouachita Children's Center and the Garland County Master Gardeners led to a vegetable garden project behind the OCC building. "It was indicated to us that the OCC needed some vegetable boxes down here," said James B. Moore Jr., who has been a master gardener since 2012 and serves as a board member at the Webb Center. "So I got together with some of the ladies and brothers of the Master Gardeners and we decided to come down and do planter boxes for OCC." The group built four garden beds, adding to the two already established boxes at OCC, and installed an aboveground irrigation system to water the garden. Some of the students helped with the garden beds' installation on Monday, Moore said. The garden is now growing vegetables and fruits including watermelon, pinto beans, peppers, okra, black-eyed peas, and tomatoes as well as marigolds. "Marigolds are designed to attract the good bugs and keep the bad bugs away," Moore said. "When Mr. James came to me with the idea and said that they would like to get the kids out and get them involved, it was a 'Yes' right away," William Wilson, executive director of OCC, said. "And then not only that, the children enjoyed it. They really did. [It] gives them something to do. Quite a few of them asked questions. They were excited about it and that's what matters." "When everything starts growing, we are hoping that they can utilize the food, the black-eyed peas, string beans, pinto beans and tomatoes, to help feed the students here at OCC," Moore said. Not only will the garden provide food, it was also able to provide knowledge and experience for the children at OCC, Wilson said. Jodi Tooke, president of the Master Gardeners, said part of their mission is educating the community about horticulture. "If just two or three remember this day in time and really understand the horticulture part of it, it'll be a blessing to their families and to themselves," Wilson said. "I think there's a lot of benefit to it beyond just their learning about gardening,"said. "We, of course, want to encourage that so that young people will carry on the tradition of gardening and get from it what we get: that sense of accomplishment, that sense of peace, of unity with nature." The Master Gardeners participate in about 16 community service projects throughout Garland County, Tooke said. With about 200 members in the county, each Master Gardener receives 40 hours of initial training and horticulture practices from the University of Arkansas followed by 20 hours of community service each year. Moore said he hoped the Master Gardeners would have the chance to return later in the year and plant fall and winter garden vegetables including lettuce, radishes and cabbage, noting it's possible the garden will expand someday by adding even more garden beds.

         HOT SPRINGS -- For the first time since the covid-19 pandemic began, the Hot Springs Area Cultural Alliance will host an in-person quarterly networking meeting July 11 from 5:30-7:30 p.m. "I think it was prior to the pandemic," the executive director of the HSACA, Mary Zunick, told The Sentinel-Record about the last time the alliance met in person. "I think it was probably at the very beginning of 2020." The reinstatement of in-person quarterly networking meetings offers the arts community opportunities to gather, network and discuss upcoming events or opportunities, a news release from the HSACA stated. "As you might recall for Arts & the Park, in 2020 and 2021, we were almost all outside, so we tried to be very cautious and follow CDC guidelines," Zunick said. "But this year for 2022, after Arts & the Park in May, we decided that we would go ahead and proceed and resume with the quarterly networking meetings." The HSACA plans to use the July meeting to announce the theme for the 2023 Arts & the Park festival. It will also "take place shortly before the 33rd anniversary of Hot Springs' Gallery Walk," giving members a chance to prepare for the celebration, the release said. The alliance hosted a few meetings online through Zoom over the last two years, but "they just weren't as well-attended as the in-person meetings," Zunick added. The HSACA's mission is "to celebrate, advocate and promote the arts and culture of our area," she said. "Part of that is being able to gather together and share information about what's going on with individual artists or arts organizations. And being able to communicate in person just helps bind our arts community together." The meeting will take place in The Warehouse, 301 Broadway St., "donated" by Gefer Sims, who owns The Warehouse and Esther's Gallery & Gifts, the release said. The upcoming meeting is open to interested members of the community and free to attend. "  Print Headline: Cultural alliance plans to resume networking

         HOT SPRINGS -- The committee the Hot Springs Police Department formed to bolster recruiting met for the first time last week. Recent recruiting drives haven't turned out applicants in numbers needed to fill 10 to 12 vacancies in the 115 uniformed positions budgeted for 2022, including five partially funded by the U.S. Department of Justice Community Oriented Policing Services grant the city was awarded last year. "We've hit a wall in our recruiting efforts," Police Chief Chris Chapmond told the Civil Service Commission last week. "We are recruiting a younger generation, and, to be honest with you, I don't have the answers any more. "We have put together a good group of young men and women from the civilian and uniformed side. We are going to implement their ideas within the next several weeks. We've got to do something different to reach the men and women of our community." The two-month recruiting drive for the special testing session the commission authorized in March netted 10 applicants, eight of whom took physical and written tests May 21. All eight passed and were interviewed and ranked by the commission. Chapmond said background checks were being conducted and interviews with command staff will be held in a few weeks. He said the background check disqualifies about 90% of applicants. "There's several good candidates," he told the commission. "It's not enough to fill the vacant positions, but I do believe there's some very qualified young men in there." Certified law enforcement officers, or those certified before next June, will receive the $5,000 one-time stipend authorized by Act 224, which the Legislature passed earlier this year. The consent agenda the Hot Springs Board of Directors will consider Tuesday night includes a resolution authorizing the police department to apply for and accept the stipends. Chapmond and Fire Chief Ed Davis gave reports to the commission. Chapmond said two officers placed on administrative leave after the May 12 shooting at the Hot Springs Convention Center returned to work last week. Charles Johnson Jr., 25, was charged with first-degree murder in the death of Michael Jordan, 39, and three counts of first-degree battery in the shooting of three victims who suffered non-life-threatening injuries. According to the probable cause affidavit, Hot Springs police were among the agencies that responded to a fight after the Hot Springs World Class High School graduation. A man later identified as Johnson began shooting as officers were breaking up the fight. "We engaged the suspect and returned fire," Chapmond said. Johnson was treated at a local hospital for multiple gunshot wounds. The department is renewing its accreditation through the Arkansas Association of Chiefs of Police. It was the first AACP-accredited agency. "It's allowed us to review our policies and update them," Chapmond said. "We've reviewed more than 20 and made some sort of changes to update them." The department's new drones have arrived. A budget adjustment the city board adopted in March provided $50,000 for the drone program. Chapmond said the drones will be used to track suspects and at special events and critical incidents. Sean Willits, the department's peer recovery specialist, received an advanced certificate. Chapmond said Willits made 241 contacts last month and sent 18 people to recovery. "Every person we can send to recovery is a potential person we're not dealing with on the street who's fighting an addiction, who's committing a crime to support that addiction," he said. Chapmond said the department seized a large number of fentanyl pills earlier this month. "Those pills could potentially kill any individual that took them," he said of the synthetic opioid linked to numerous overdose deaths. Chapmond is serving on the Arkansas School Safety Commission. He said the panel is meeting three times a week and will present its report to the governor in August. Davis said the fire department is using a cooling trailer to fight heat exhaustion at fire scenes.  Print Headline: Spa City steps up recruiting of police

        A team of AmeriCorps members are spending the summer helping local hunger relief organizations provide fresh produce to those in need. Cobblestone Farms, a nonprofit farm in Fayetteville, received an AmeriCorps grant for a team of 11 volunteers to spend 12 weeks working in Northwest Arkansas, according to Executive Director Kelton Hayes. The farm doesnt need that many corps members working 40 hours a week. So the nonprofit is sharing the workers with organizations that have a similar mission of addressing food insecurity, including the Northwest Arkansas Food Bank, Samaritan Community Center, Appleseeds Teaching Farm, St. James Baptist Church Food Pantry and Mount Comfort Presbyterian Church, he said. Hayes believes in collaboration. “You can go fast alone, but we can go far together,” he said. “We know there is a lot to be done in our community, so why would we not work with any other organization that is either specifically working on food insecurity or wanting to make our community a better place.” Corps team members have divided into groups of two and three and are serving three-week rotations at each organization May 5 through Aug. 5, Hayes said. The corps members are helping organizations during the busiest part of the garden season and providing nonprofits with the staff to expand their operations in some cases, program directors said. The 11 volunteers are taking on tasks ranging from garden chores — such as planting and harvesting vegetables — to helping distribute food. The helpers are part of the National Civilian Community Corps of Americorps. The federally funded program allows 18- to 26-year-old volunteers to spend periods of 10 to 11 months serving in the areas of energy conservation, infrastructure, urban and rural development, and disaster services, according to an AmeriCorps spokesperson. The team serving at Cobblestone Farms is based in Aurora, Colo., and spent its first two 12-week sessions building and restoring homes in Houston to help with recovery from Hurricane Harvey of 2017 and the ice storms of February 2021, said team leader Kara Neal of Great Falls, Mont. Team members serve 1,700 direct hours as well as 80 individual service hours during their months of service, Neal said. All their expenses are paid, and they receive a small stipend while serving, she said. They also receive an education stipend of $6,000 when they complete their term of service, she said. Some team members are fresh out of high school, while others are college students or graduates, she said. Cobblestone Farms has used AmeriCorps volunteers in the past through grants written by the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences and Appleseeds Teaching Farm, Hayes said. This is the first year the farm has taken on the task of writing the grant, he said. While AmeriCorps didnt assign a dollar value to the grant, Hayes estimated corps members will be providing $80,000 worth of labor to the local hunger relief organizations. Cobblestone leases 25 acres off Wedington Drive from New Heights Church at no cost, Hayes said. The nonprofit uses sustainable and organic practices to raise everything from arugula to zucchini in its gardens, as well as sheep, pigs and broiler chickens, he said. The farm plans to produce 25,000 to 30,000 pounds of food this year to be donated to local hunger relief organizations such as the Northwest Arkansas Food Bank, he said. The organization also sells a small portion of its produce through a harvest share program, he said. Locally and sustainably grown food tends to be out of reach for a lot of families, Hayes said. The nonprofit aims to provide access to fresh, local, nutrient-dense food, he said. About 13% of households in Benton, Carroll, Madison and Washington counties were food insecure in 2019, according to Feeding America. The organization defines food insecurity as a lack of consistent access to enough food for every person in a household to live an active, healthy lifestyle. Like Cobblestone Farms, Samaritan Community Center is expanding its garden operation, according to Megan Thomas, garden coordinator. The nonprofit has a garden on one-third of an acre in Rogers that grows organic vegetables, fruits and flowers for its market and cafes in Springdale and Rogers. The markets and cafes provide free food and meals to those in need, she said. The garden produces about 15,000 pounds of organic produce a year, but is moving to a 1.5-acre location on the south side of Rogers, which will allow it to increase the amount of food it grows, expand its reach and provide more educational opportunities, she said. Americorps members are helping Samaritan maintain its current garden so staff can focus on preparing the new site, Thomas said. “Partnering with other nonprofits is great because we all have similar missions, so its really beneficial for us to work together,” she said. Owen Ashley of Beaverton, Ore., joined AmeriCorps when he graduated from high school last year. He said he has enjoyed the volunteer experience and working outside. Assistant team leader Brian Freno of New Jersey graduated with a business degree last year and said he joined the corps to see the country and meet people. “Its been a really good experience,” he said. “Ive gained a lot of skills, a lot of life experience and made a lot of good friends.” The corps members are keeping the food pantry at St. James Missionary Baptist Church in Fayetteville from being understaffed during the summer, according to Monique Jones, director of outreach. The church has a food pantry that feeds about 450 families a week, Jones said. It has a drive-up pantry and delivers food in Springdale, Fayetteville, Farmington, Prairie Grove and Lincoln, she said. It also brings food boxes to all of Fayettevilles public housing projects. Summer is a great time to have extra help because many of the churchs regular volunteers are on vacation, Jones said. Corps members have been helping with tasks such as checking in drive-through clients, data entry, food delivery and cleaning the yard, she said. AmeriCorps members have been helping the Northwest Arkansas Food Bank with its quarter-acre garden on its Springdale campus, according to Haley Deatherage, garden and nutrition manager. The teaching garden is designed to show people how to grow their own healthy organic produce and produce fresh food to distribute, she said.

        AT&T has announced an upgrade to 911 that will make it easier for emergency services to locate wireless phone callers during emergencies in Arkansas. The “Locate Before Route” feature uses device GPS rather than cell towers to identify the location of a 911 call from a mobile phone, said Matt Lawson of AT&T Media Relations. While cell towers could identify a callers location within an area of 10 miles, GPS allows AT&T to identify this location within 50 meters, allowing public safety to respond faster during an emergency, Lawson said. The upgrade, which is only available on the AT&T network, is the first of its kind and now works automatically for wireless 911 calls on the network across the state, he said, and AT&T expects to launch the feature nationwide before the end of June. Juana Green, the 911 director for Little Rock, said she has heard many stories of callers who were near the border of joining jurisdictions at the time of an emergency. She said those calls have the potential to be routed to the wrong public safety answering point, or 911 call center. For example, Green said shes heard on multiple occasions about cell towers routing west Little Rock calls to Pulaski County first, then needing to transfer them to the Little Rock answering point. She said having the 911 call go directly to the correct point initially can improve call answer times. Arkansas 911 Board Executive Director C.J. Engel said in a state which currently has 98 public safety answering points, these transfers happen regularly. Each time a center transfers a call, emergency responders lose seconds or minutes as people re-tell their stories two or three times. Transfers also raise the risk of 911 dialers dropping the call, he said. But with the new technology, Engel believes this will change. “We expect that this capability will reduce the number of 911 transfers and put you to the right place, the majority of the time,” Engel said. While AT&T is currently the only platform to offer location-based routing, Engel said other companies are working on rolling out their own versions of the product. This wont be a problem, Engel said, as those without AT&T wont lose any capabilities with their carriers. They will receive the same 911 service as before, he said. When asked about other carriers, Green similarly said she has no concern that the feature is only available on AT&T. “Its just a matter of time before the others catch on,” she said. However, Engel also added that location-based routing wont “happen automatically,” as Arkansas 911 infrastructure has remained the same for 30 years and is currently undergoing updates needed before location-based routing can function. He said only nine of the states call centers have been upgraded with the necessary Next Generation 911 services, but the 911 Board is working as fast as possible to ensure all call centers can handle the new capability. But AT&T Sales Director Josh Harris, whose team has responsibility for all AT&T retail stories in Arkansas, said AT&Ts location-based routing works with all 911 call centers nationwide, “whether theyre operating under older technology or NextGen 911.” He said there is other location-based routing technology available today that only works with NextGen. He said although its crucial for all call centers to receive those NextGen services as soon as possible, “were not there as an industry.” Harris said AT&T customers will be able to take advantage of the update without having to take any action and that location-based routing is the best solution to improve emergency response times, especially for calls from remote locations. “Weve all heard stories of people who get lost while camping, their cars run off the road, theyre trapped, and they really cant tell 911 operators where they are,” Harris said. “With this location-based routing, call centers can better find your location using GPS on your phone.” According to AT&T, 80% of todays 911 calls are made from mobile devices, meaning the new technology “fills a significant need.” Additionally, 68% of American adults live in homes without landlines, a 2021 study by the National Center for Health Statistics found. When AT&T and the Federal Communications Commission created the United States 911 system in 1968, however, landlines dominated the telephone market. In response to the “tremendous growth” of mobile 911 calls, AT&T launched the feature to ensure the public continues to have fast and reliable connection to the correct answering point. Now, when AT&T customers call 911 from a mobile phone, the network identifies the devices location and routes the call to nearest call center, sending first responders to the scene faster than before. Harris said AT&T has been working on this upgrade for a long time, but only recently did the technology become available. “AT&T jumped all over that technology update,” he said. “That was a very exciting moment for AT&T.”

        <font size="4.4" face="arial" color="black">
         ROGERS -- Pinnacle Hills Promenade might have a fish petting zoo by the end of the year. Wes Haws, founder and chief executive officer of Blue Zoo aquariums, hopes to open a 22,000-square-foot store in December, though he said supply chain issues might delay the opening until 2023. The location at 2203 Promenade Blvd., within the central strip of the mall, is a $3.2 million project, Haws said. "We're constantly on the lookout for alternative offerings to bring to our visitors and Blue Zoo is just that," said David Faulkner, senior general manager of the Promenade. "We pride ourselves on having a wide variety of tenants, including retail, dining and entertainment, and we're confident that Blue Zoo will be a successful addition to our center." The first Blue Zoo moved into Spokane, Wash., in 2018, followed by an Oklahoma City location in July 2020 and a Baton Rouge, La., location in April 2021, Haws said. Plans are also in the works for a Blue Zoo aquarium in Boise, Idaho, where the company is based, according to a news release. The closest aquarium to Rogers is Wonders of Wildlife National Museum & Aquarium in Springfield, Mo., about 100 miles away. When scouting potential Blue Zoo locations, Haws said the company looks for cities and regions that have 1 million people and no aquarium within 100 miles. Rogers met the criteria, he said. "It's super fast-growing, very friendly to business and what we're trying to do," said Haws about the city. He said he also enjoys opening aquariums inland because many children have never seen most of the animals and fish in-person before. Among the store's 22 exhibits will live an array of wildlife ranging from birds to butterflies to stingrays, he said. The aquarium will include three reptile rooms, a stingray touch pool, a 45,000-gallon shark tank and an Amazon River exhibit with an arapaima, which is among the world's largest freshwater fish. Though the aquarium won't specialize in particularly exotic creatures, visitors of all ages will get to interact with the animals by petting the stingrays, feeding the birds and walking through a room full of butterflies, he said. The Rogers store will be the first time Blue Zoo has installed a butterfly room, he said. For admission to the aquarium, guests will purchase day passes -- $20 for adults and $17 for children -- or year-round passes for $40. Discounts for groups of 12 or more and members of the military will also be available. Haws also hopes the space, which will have a DJ booth and dance floor, will be a community center, hosting events like office and birthday parties, he said. "Developments such as these are attractive to employers, retirees, relocators and others looking to move to the area or do business here," said J.R. Shaw, executive director of Visit Rogers. "That in turn creates more opportunities for all of our communities." Shaw said demand for unique venue space is high in the region, so special events should do well at the business. The aquarium will join other entertainment attractions at the Promenade including Dave & Buster's and a Malco movie theater. The Planning Commission approved a permit for the fish petting zoo May 17. Construction has since started on the project, according to Haws.  Print Headline: Blue Zoo aims to open in 2022

         FAYETTEVILLE -- A five-story, 422-unit apartment complex would serve as the first major project on empty land that opened for development after the city completed an extension of Van Asche Drive to Arkansas 112 nearly seven years ago. The Subdivision Committee of the Planning Commission on Thursday reviewed a development plan for the apartment complex called Pointe Fayetteville planned on nearly 38 acres southwest of Van Asche Drive and Gregg Avenue. The full commission will review the plan at a later date. The complex would sit back from the intersection, leaving room for future development. The project marks the first phase of a planned six-phase development, according to a letter to city planners from Bryan Moore of DBA Architects in Fayetteville. The entire site planned for development comprises about 389 acres. The proposed structure would be a five-story, wood-framed "wrap" concealing a parking garage in the center that could accommodate 704 cars, the letter says. The building would also house a club, fitness and leasing facility. Tenants would have access to a swimming pool, courtyards and a roof garden, according to the letter. Valet trash service would be available. The letter proposes having 56% of the 422 units as one-bedroom, 40% as two-bedroom and 4% as three-bedroom. The owner and developer behind the project is Keith Richardson of North Little Rock. The land's ownership is listed under Richardson's Riverpointe Development LLC on Washington County property records. The city finished extending Van Asche Drive west to Arkansas 112 in September 2015 using money from a transportation bond issue voters approved in 2006. The project created a widened section of Van Asche with two car lanes in each direction heading east and west and a 5-foot-wide sidewalk on the north and south sides of the road and 10-foot-wide trail on the south side. The Van Asche extension served as a leg of an arterial loop known as the "Mayor's Box" around the central part of the city. The loop goes from where Rupple Road becomes Howard Nickell Road in the northwest part of town, then curves east and becomes Arkansas 112 before transitioning to Van Asche Drive. The rest of the loop takes a short route north along Steele Boulevard and follows Joyce Boulevard east, turning south down Crossover Road and heading back west through Happy Hollow Road and 15th Street. It takes a slight route north on Razorback Road to get to Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard and resumes west until hitting Rupple Road. The final link of the Mayor's Box was completed on Rupple Road in 2020. The Pointe Fayetteville project would extend Roosevelt Avenue from the north and Shiloh Drive from the east with roundabouts to lead traffic into and out of the complex. City planning staff talked about the width of the proposed streets during Thursday's meeting. Blake Jorgensen with Jorgensen and Associates, serving as engineer on the project, said the developers anticipate about 17,000 daily car trips in and out of the site once the rest of the acreage is built out. Jorgensen proposed wider street extensions than city staff suggested to handle the flow of traffic. City planners asked for more details about the full scope of the project. The city is in the middle of designing a railroad crossing at Gregg Avenue and Shiloh Drive to accommodate development. The plan for the apartment complex incorporates that crossing into its design. The project is separate from another nearby planned development. Plans are underway to turn the former Drake Farms site, made up of about 175 acres south of the Fulbright Expressway, into a mixed-use development project. Washington Regional Medical Center bought 15 of the acres for a planned expansion west of its campus. The hospital's plans for the property include facilities for expanded inpatient hospital services, outpatient surgical services, overnight stay capabilities, ambulatory care services and a center for wellness focused on whole-person care, according to a September news release from Washington Regional. A spokeswoman for Washington Regional Medical Center said the hospital does not anticipate the Pointe Fayetteville development having any negative impact for patients, physicians or visitors accessing the campus. "Washington Regional is aware of the proposed development, and we have full confidence the city of Fayetteville will thoroughly review and respond to the proposal in an appropriate manner that ensures the best interest of both city residents and businesses," a statement said.

         BENTONVILLE -- Alexandra Williams' goal is to be an FBI agent. She spent the last two weeks learning about law enforcement from Bentonville police officers. Alexandra, 14, was one of about a dozen teens who participated in the latest Bentonville Police Youth Academy. The academy was open to students entering the ninth grade through high school. Alexandra, who will be a freshman at Bentonville High School, said she learned about police officers and gained more respect for them and the job they do. "They are actually nice people," she said. "People shouldn't judge the book by the cover." She said Cpl. Chris Isbell, the school resource officer at Fulbright Junior High School, told her about the academy. Isbell inspired her to want a law enforcement career. Alexandra and the other teens spent Friday morning watching a demonstration by the department's SWAT team. One of the team members set off a flash bang. The teens also got a chance to use battering rams to knock in doors. Adam McInnis, police spokesman, said the first academy was held in 2014, and the department missed two years because of covid-19. McInnis said the students learned about every area of the department. The goal of the academy is to build relationships while engaging with young people interested in law enforcement careers. "We are engaging with the community," McInnis said. "We are also exposing the students to law enforcement and giving them experiences that are helpful to them." The students spent time learning about laws and even traffic codes. They met with prosecutors. They saw the department's various police dogs, McInnis said. They also watched the bomb squad's robot and learned how the team X-rays suspicious packages. The police officers and students spent time Friday morning playing kickball in Memorial Park after the demonstration by the SWAT team. A graduation was held Friday afternoon. Boyd Gunderson, 14, who will be a freshman at West High School, said he wants to be a police officer and enjoyed his time in the youth academy. "I thought it was a great time to learn about law enforcement, and it gives us a lot of unique experiences," he said. Boyd said the two most important lessons were the importance of community and teamwork. He and Alexandra want to take part in next year's academy. Isbell said he enjoyed working with the students. "Being able to help assist with the youth academy is extremely rewarding," Isbell said. "To see today's youth have a positive interaction with police is much needed in today's time."

            <h2>Inflation taking bite out of new infrastructure projects</h2>

        The price of a foot of water pipe in Tucson, Arizona: up 19%. The cost of a ton of asphalt in a small Massachusetts town: up 37%. The estimate to build a new airport terminal in Des Moines, Iowa: 69% higher, with a several year delay. Inflation is taking a toll on infrastructure projects across the U.S., driving up costs so much that state and local officials are postponing projects, scaling back others and reprioritizing their needs. The price hikes already are diminishing the value of a $1 trillion infrastructure plan President Joe Biden signed into law just seven months ago. That law had included, among other things, a roughly 25% increase in regular highway program funding for states. “Those dollars are essentially evaporating,” said Jim Tymon, executive director of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials. "The cost of those projects is going up by 20%, by 30%, and just wiping out that increase from the federal government that they were so excited about earlier in the year.” In Casper, Wyoming, the low bid to rebuild a major intersection and construct a new bridge over the North Platte River came in at $35 million this spring — 55% over a state engineer's estimate. The bid was rejected and the project delayed as state officials re-evaluate their options. “If this inflation keeps the way it is, we will have to roll projects from one year into the next, into the next, into the next," said Mark Gillett, chief engineer of the Wyoming Department of Transportation. Gillett had hoped the federal Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act would finance a boom in highway and bridge construction. “But its just not going to go as far as we had hoped,” he said. In addition to roads, the federal infrastructure bill includes billions of dollars for water projects, railways, airports, broadband internet, electric grids and green-energy projects over the coming years. Inflation has affected the entire U.S. economy, posing one of Biden's biggest challenges during a midterm election year. Fuel, food and housing costs all have shot up. Consumer prices surged 8.6% in May over last year, the highest rate since 1981, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. Prices for some key materials in infrastructure construction have risen even more. Prices paid to U.S. manufacturers of asphalt paving and tar mixtures were up 14% in May compared to last year, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Prices for fabricated steel plate, used in bridges, were up 23%, and ductile iron pipes and fittings — used by water systems — were nearly 25% higher. The hikes are being driven by a variety of factors, including worldwide supply-chain backlogs, strong consumer and business spending in the U.S., Russia's invasion of Ukraine — and, some argue, federal energy and fiscal policies. U.S. Rep. Sam Graves, the ranking minority member on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, contends the infrastructure law itself is contributing to inflation by pouring more federal money into an economy already flush with trillions of dollars in federal pandemic aid. “They are borrowing more money so they can spend more money, (which) is driving inflation, which is cutting down on the projects that theyre actually wanting to do,” said Graves, a Missouri Republican who voted against the infrastructure bill. White House senior adviser Mitch Landrieu said the infrastructure law “actually positions us for lowering costs for families in the short- and long-term." He pointed, among other things, to made-in America requirements for steel, iron and other construction materials that could strengthen supply chains and thus lower costs. Officials at Des Moines International Airport were counting on the federal infrastructure money to replace an aging terminal with a modern structure. Four years ago, a new 14-gate terminal was projected to cost about $434 million and be open by 2026. By this spring, the cost had soared to $733 million. Thats more than the airport can afford, even with the federal aid. So officials are planning to break the project into phases, building just five new gates by 2026 at a cost of $411 million. “If inflation continues, it may be a decade before the project gets completely done,” airport Executive Director Kevin Foley said. Other projects also have been rocked by inflationary price hikes. Since voters approved a property tax increase in 2020, the estimated cost of building two light rail lines and a tunnel through Austin, Texas, has gone from $5.8 billion to $10.3 billion. Doubling the tunnel length was a big factor. But inflation and surging real estate prices also fueled the increase, forcing officials to consider cutting costs or lengthening the time frame for completing the project. “Its been a challenge,” said David Couch, chief program officer at the Austin Transit Partnership. Low bids for a series of bridge repairs along Interstate 55 in St. Louis came in at $63 million this year, 57% over the budgeted amount. Overall, Missouris highway construction costs for the fiscal year ending in June were $139 million over budget — an 11% increase that marked a “pretty significant swing” from several under-budget years, said state Department of Transportation Director Patrick McKenna. Though Missouri forged ahead with this year's projects, inflation “will take a bite out of the future,” McKenna said. Inflation has carried more immediate consequence in some places. When bids for a road project in Lansing, Michigan, came in 60% above estimates, the city rebid the project and cut its scope in half, said Andrew Kilpatrick, public service director and acting city engineer. In Huntington, Massachusetts, a 1.5-mile stretch of road won't be finished this year after a 37% spike in the price of liquid asphalt increased the cost for paving a mile to about $140,000. The town gets $159,000 annually in state funding for its roads, highway superintendent Charles Dazelle said. “Right now, one mile of road, thats one year. That is doing nothing else,” Dazelle said. Public water systems across the country also are straining under inflation. When Tucson, Arizona, launched the first part of a four-phase water main replacement project in September 2020, ductile iron pipe cost $75-a-foot and a gate valve cost $3,000. When it bid the most recent phase this spring, pipe costs had risen to nearly $90-a-foot and gate valves to nearly $4,100. The city is now prioritizing what other projects it can afford, and which ones have to wait. “To sum it up, were doing less work for the same amount of money,” said Tucson's chief water engineer, Scott Schladweiler. The city of Tacoma, Washington, also is altering some of its planned water main replacements because of rising costs. “Some of them are getting delayed, some of them are being reduced in scope, and its forcing us to re-evaluate some of the budgets that weve set forth,” said Ali Polda, principal engineer in the city's water department. Residents in a neighborhood west of Little Rock, Arkansas, will pay a $146 monthly surcharge to Central Arkansas Water to install new water lines. The charge is 17% more than originally planned because of spikes in construction costs. Other public utilities also will have to choose between scaling back work and passing along costs to customers, said Michael Arceneaux, acting CEO of the Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies. “In the end, its going to be the rate payers that suffer,” he said, "because the projects have to get done, and funding will have to come from the rate payers.”

        Despite Saturday's humid heat, the Juneteenth festivities on West Ninth Street had the biggest turnout Key Fletcher has seen, she said. Fletcher is the director of the Mosaic Templars Cultural Center, which coordinated many of Saturday's events throughout Little Rock as part of Juneteenth in Da Rock, in honor of the holiday that African Americans have celebrated for decades, even though it was not declared a federal holiday until 2021. Juneteenth marks the date -- June 19, 1865 -- that Union soldiers landed at Galveston, Texas, with news that the Civil War had ended and that enslaved people in that state were officially free. The holiday is still a celebration of freedom, said Erica O'Neal, a Little Rock businesswoman who sold jewelry and handbags at the corner of Ninth and Gaines streets. "Freedom to celebrate who you are, freedom to celebrate your struggles, freedom to celebrate your accomplishments and achievements," O'Neal said. "It's freedom to be you. It really makes me feel good to see so many people out here celebrating." West Ninth Street was the hub of a thriving Little Rock Black business district throughout much of the 20th century, so the three blocks between Broadway and State Street played host to a wide range of food, art, clothing and other vendors Saturday. Fletcher said 130 vendors were present in partnership with the Mosaic Templars, and the Building Black Communities fund provided 40 free vendor booths to grant recipients. Supporting Black artists and entrepreneurs is a high priority for the Mosaic Templars, Fletcher said.  "  Brandi Washington drove in from Hot Springs to set up a booth for her clothing store, The Skirt Shop 101. She said she appreciated the networking opportunity, as well as the ability to "celebrate being free in a safe environment with like minds." Mosaic Templars has held Juneteenth in Da Rock for 13 years, but the past few years have amplified the need to recognize Black history, Fletcher said. "People are looking for a way to recognize the importance and achievements of African Americans," she said. "I think in the past few years we began to see almost a reckoning in our communities [about] the importance of African American history." In addition to the street market, Juneteenth in Da Rock included a 5K race through some of Little Rock's most historic Black neighborhoods, live music and dancing throughout the day at the Main Stage set up on Arch Street, interactive displays at The Hall for children to learn about the history of Juneteenth and a screening of the Arkansas PBS documentary "Dreamland: Little Rock's West 9th Street" at the Ron Robinson Theatre on River Market Avenue. Juneteenth in Da Rock was a largely virtual event in 2020 and 2021 because of the covid-19 pandemic, Fletcher said, and the increased attendance this year might have been a result. The recognition of Juneteenth as a federal holiday last year might have also fueled the celebrations this year, she said. "We've never needed anybody to tell us that our history is important, but we need legislation so that people don't forget," she said. DeMonica McClurge's teenage daughter thought Juneteenth was a celebration of Martin Luther King Jr., so McClurge decided they needed to drive to Little Rock from Sherwood on Saturday as both a fun and educational outing, she said. McClurge had never celebrated the holiday before, and she said it felt "like celebrating the 4th of July from here until the 4th of July." "It's a celebration of my ancestors and who they were and where we've come," she said. Little Rock saw other festivities Saturday independently of Juneteenth in Da Rock. The Arkansas Martin Luther King Jr. Commission held a gathering on the state Capitol steps Saturday morning, featuring a keynote speech from Broadway Joe Booker of radio station KIPR-FM, 92.3, "Power 92." Just before Booker started his speech, police ordered attendees to evacuate the Capitol premises due to an apparent bomb threat. The event resumed a few minutes later at the intersection of Capitol Avenue and Woodlane Street. Little Rock police got several calls reporting threats in different parts of the city Saturday, department spokesman Sgt. Eric Barnes said, but officers checked each scene and did not discover any explosives or other threats. Furthermore, none of the reports indicated the threat was directly related to a Juneteenth celebration. Police traced many of the calls to a woman in North Little Rock who suffers from mental health issues and has made false reports with police before, Barnes said. North Little Rock police were alerted of the false reports and are looking into providing mental health care for the woman through a social worker, he said. When Booker was able to start his speech, he recounted the difficulties of getting the information about the end of slavery to Galveston, Texas, since some Confederate soldiers refused to surrender after the Civil War ended. "As African Americans, I don't think a lot of us think of the 4th of July as our freedom day," he said. The Arkansas Martin Luther King Jr. Commission is a division of the Arkansas Department of Education meant to promote the legacy of the civil rights icon. The commission values the involvement of young people in its cause and in Saturday's event, which included singing and dancing, commission Executive Director DuShun Scarbrough said. "It's important to teach them the reason we celebrate Juneteenth, as opposed to just celebrating it," he said. "I find it important to empower youth to be change agents." Doris McPhee Jackson brought her two teenage nieces to the Capitol for their first Juneteenth celebration to teach them the meaning of the holiday, she said. She has lived in Little Rock since 1983 and watched local Juneteenth celebrations grow over time, she said. "Everybody can participate in Juneteenth," McPhee Jackson said. "Everybody has a part of history in Juneteenth and that's how I see it. As we do it year after year, it gets bigger, and we get more diverse communities coming together."

        Without a vote to spare, state Department of Transformation and Shared Services Secretary Amy Fecher was hired by the trustees of the Arkansas Public Employees Retirement System as its new executive director earlier this month, system records show. Seven trustees voted for Fecher's appointment, while four trustees voted against her appointment and two trustees abstained, the system's records revealed in a response to the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette's request under the Arkansas Freedom of Information Act for any correspondence relating to the trustees' votes on June 1 to hire Fecher. The trustees voted to hire Fecher in a voice vote to lead state government's second-largest retirement system, which has more than $10 billion in investments and more than 75,000 working and retired members. She will start work on July 1 with a starting salary of $165,396 a year. In interviews after the divided vote, two trustees said they voted against Fecher because she lacked a financial degree. Another trustee said he voted against her because he favored another candidate with investment experience. Fecher was selected over state treasurer's office Senior Investment Manager Steve Pulley; the retirement system's Chief Investment Officer Carlos Borromeo; and retired Fredericksburg, Texas, City Manager Kent Myers, who is a former Hot Springs city manager. At least a few trustees could be heard during the June 1 meeting dissenting from the vote to hire Fecher. But it wasn't clear how many trustees dissented because none of the trustees asked for a roll call vote and board Chairwoman Candace Franks didn't ask if any trustees abstained from the vote before they departed from the meeting. In a text to Pulley on June 2, Arkansas Municipal League Executive Director Mark Hayes wrote "I tried to push you through, but i think it came down to politics like [Duncan] Baird's appointment. "You'd have been perfect. The system stinks sometimes," Hayes wrote in his text to Pulley obtained by this newspaper under the Arkansas Freedom of Information Act. Trustee Larry Walther, secretary of the state Department of Finance and Administration, declined to comment about the text, said Scott Hardin, a finance department spokesman. In 2019, the system's trustees hired then-state budget administrator Duncan Baird as executive director in a voice vote with no dissenters. Trustees selected Baird over actuary Jody Carreiro and Borromeo. Baird's predecessor, Gail Stone, served as the system's executive director from July 1, 2001 until Dec. 31, 2018. Baird, who is a former Republican state representative from Lowell, departed the system on April 9 to begin work as senior manager of benefit services at Walmart where he is responsible for administering Walmart's 401 (k) plan. According to system records provided by interim system director Allison Woods in response to the Arkansas Freedom of Information Act request, the seven trustees who voted to select Fecher were: Workers Compensation Commission Chairman Dale Douthit. State Department of Labor and Licensing Secretary Daryl Bassett. Sebastian County Judge David Hudson. Van Buren Mayor Joe Hurst. Retired state House assistant coordinator/assistant to the House speaker Kaye Donham. Walther. Retired Alma Police Chief Russell White, who is the chief of police at the Northwest Arkansas National Airport. Douthit, Bassett, Hudson, Hurst and Walther are each appointees of Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson. White and Donham were both appointed by House Speaker Matthew Shepherd, R-El Dorado. According to the records provided by Woods, the four trustees who voted against selecting Fecher included: State Auditor Andrea Lea, a Republican from Russellville Retired Bureau of Legislative Research assistant director of research Richard Wilson. Retired Arkansas Game and Fish Commission law enforcement corporal Gary Wallace. Hot Springs City Engineer Gary Carnahan. Wilson and Wallace are both appointees of Senate President Pro Tempore Jimmy Hickey, R-Texarkana. Carnahan is an appointee of Hutchinson. As state auditor, Lea serves on the system's board under state law. Trustee Jason Brady, who is chief deputy state treasurer for operations, and Franks, who is the state's retired bank commissioner, both abstained from the vote, according to the records provided by Woods. Brady serves on the board as the representative of Republican state Treasurer Dennis Milligan of Benton. The state treasurer serves on the board under state law. Earlier this month, Brady said that he abstained from voting on hiring Fecher because one of the treasurer's office employees was a candidate for executive director. Franks, who is an appointee of Hutchinson, said last week that she typically doesn't vote as the board's chairman unless she has to vote to break a tie, but "I think the board made a good decision." After the trustees selected Fecher, Hutchinson said earlier this month that "This was a decision made by the board independently and I applaud their diligence in the selection process." On Thursday, Hickey said Thursday that he didn't indicate his preference for either Wallace or Wilson. Asked about the trustees' selection of Fecher, Hickey, who is among her legislative critics, said Thursday, "I don't have any comment." Shepherd said Thursday in a written statement that "I did not contact any of my appointees to the APERS Board of Trustees regarding the Executive Director position. "As with the many actions of our boards and commissions, I trust members make decisions in the best interest of the state of Arkansas," Shepherd said. JOB DESCRIPTION Fecher, who has a bachelor's degree in physical science from the University of Central Arkansas, has been secretary of the state Department of Transformation and Shared Services since 2019. She also served as the state's chief transformation officer from 2016-2019, executive vice president for the Arkansas Economic Development Commission from 2015-2019 and director of the Department of Rural Services in 2015 under Hutchinson, according to her resume. She worked as assistant director in Gov. Mike Huckabee's office from 2000-2001, deputy director of the Department of Rural Services from 2001-2005 and as legislative consultant and liaison for state officials for the Hutchinson Group consulting firm from 2005-2007, her resume states. The job description for the retirement system executive director post calls for minimum education and/or experience that includes a bachelor's degree in business administration, accounting, finance, economics, public administration or a related field and five years of executive experience reporting directly to corporate or public leadership, including three years in a supervisory or managerial capacity. Woods said in an email dated April 22 to the five trustees on the selection committee that if any of the 21 applicants for the job did not meet at least one component of the three components of the minimum requirements, they would be determined to not have met the overall minimum requirements. "For the degree requirement, which mentions a related field, we accepted any field of study as long as they had earned a degree," she said. Acting as a spokesman for Walther, who served as chairman of the trustees' selection committee, Hardin said Thursday in a written statement that "The decision by APERS staff to allow any bachelor's degree to proceed (in combination with the other requirements) provided the selection committee the discretion to determine whether a degree was within a related field as there was not a formal list of related degrees. "While a bachelor's degree may be required for positions throughout state government, it is not uncommon for hiring officials to have discretion regarding the type of degree," he said. Hardin said that Walther indicated that nine applicants were determined to meet requirements based on information provided to him by the system's staff, and the selection committee on April 28 chose four candidates for an interview. The selection committee include Walther, Bassett, Carnahan, Wilson and Lea. Earlier this month, Wilson said he voted against hiring Fecher because "we had a disagreement on a technical issue. "Amy meets a lot of requirements. We all know that," he said. But Wilson said that "the way that they were written there was a disagreement" about whether the bachelor's degree needs to be in business administration, accounting, finance, economics, public administration or a related field. Lea said earlier this month that she voted against selecting Fecher because Fecher's bachelor's degree "is in science and not finance and the other candidates all had financial backgrounds and degrees." But Carnahan said last week that "to me, that was not a hardline rule" for the executive director to have a bachelor's degree in a finance-related field. While he said he voted against hiring Fecher as the system's executive director, he said that "I was really voting for one of the other candidates," whom he declined to identify. "She is very strong in having a good understanding of working with the legislative process, and the governor's office and and also managed government agencies," Carnahan aid. "We are all 110 % behind her and will do everything we can to work with her." White said he voted to select Fecher as the system's executive director because he felt like she was the best choice for the position. He said Fecher -- who has experience in dealing with lawmakers regarding legislation and will reach out to the system's members at town hall meetings -- and one of the candidates with financial investment experience, whom he declined to identify, had the best interviews for the job. Borromeo already provides "really good financial leadership for the system," White said. White said lobbyist Rett Hatcher, a former aide to Hutchinson, endorsed Fecher as the best candidate for the system's executive director job. "Nobody said the governor wanted her for the job."

        Ebony Mitchell, a 25-year-old graduate student from Harrison, took the Miss Arkansas 2022 title on Saturday night in Little Rock. The outgoing Miss Arkansas, Whitney Williams, crowned Mitchell as she received a bouquet of red roses, confetti fell and the other 40 candidates rushed to congratulate her onstage at Robinson Center. “A Responsible Digital You” is Mitchells social impact initiative, the cause she will further during her year as Miss Arkansas. “Its all about being safe online and teaching Arkansas children, especially, how to be safe,” Mitchell said. Mitchell won the Miss Dogwood pageant in November to qualify for the state competition. She had also competed at Miss Arkansas 2021 and finished as the first runner-up to Williams. She is a 2019 graduate of University of Central Arkansas and is currently pursuing a Masters of Business Administration with an emphasis in Health Administration from John Brown University. The maximum age for Miss Arkansas candidates is 24. However, the would-be candidates for the 2020 competition, which was postponed because of covid-19, received an extra year of eligibility. After this year, Mitchell said she would have aged out of the scholarship competition, and she hopes her legacy as Miss Arkansas will be one of grace, impact and resilience. “I want people to remember me as the Miss Arkansas that provided everyone with a smile, that could talk to anyone and that can make anyone feel like they are valued, capable and seen,” she said. The 10 finalists, named at the beginning of the Saturday finals, competed in onstage question, talent and evening wear segments throughout the night. Mitchell answered a question from Miss Steel Capital, Piper Stallings, during the onstage interview portion. When asked her thoughts on “cancel culture,” she said she doesnt believe that by making mistakes, a person should be “canceled forever.” “I believe in forgiveness, and I believe in giving second chances,” Mitchell said. “I would love to see cancel culture come to an end in our lifetime.” During the talent or artistic expression segment, candidates showed their skills ranging from playing the fiddle to acrobatic jazz. Mitchell competed with an energetic tap dance to Aretha Franklins “Respect,” including elements of gymnastics that received applause from the packed crowd. As she finished her dance performance, friends and family members cheered and held up signs with her face. The Miss Arkansas Scholarship Foundation is the nonprofit organization which raises funds for the competition. As the next Miss Arkansas, Mitchell will receive a $30,000 scholarship. The foundation awarded every Miss Arkansas candidate $400. In total, this years competition awarded $167,300 in scholarships. Coming from a single-mother home, Mitchell said she once believed it would be impossible for her to attend college. She said her participation in the scholarship competition over the years has allowed her to pursue both her bachelors and masters degrees. Mitchell will compete at the Miss America pageant in Connecticut in December. Three Miss Arkansas title holders have won the national competition. Most recently, Savvy Shields Wolfe won the title in 2016. Sydney Wendfeldt, a 26-year-old from Mountain Home, was the Miss Arkansas 2022 first runner-up.   Gallery: Miss Arkansas 2022

        OMAHA -- The Arkansas Razorback Foundation and the Alumni Association hosted a pregame brunch for their members at DJ's Dugout Sports Bar and Grill just blocks from Charles Schwab Stadium where the Razorback played their first game of the College World Series. A large inflated Razorback marked the entrance to the large restaurant, which had about 350 guests in attendance. Once inside, they were able to select from an array of free Razorback souvenirs including pom-poms, T-shirts, sunglasses and bottles of sun screen for the 93-degree afternoon game.  John Nabors and Justin Acri with the radio station 103.7 The Buzz were on site and broadcast a pregame show from the restaurant, and Big Red -- the Razorback mascot -- led the entire restaurant in calling the Hogs. The Razorbacks beat Stanford in their opening-round game 17-2. The team will continue on in the winner's bracket of the double-elimination tournament, and will face SEC foe on Monday.   Gallery: Arkansas Fans in Omaha  Print Headline: Razorback groups meet in Nebraska

        The upswing of covid-19 cases in Arkansas continued Saturday with 708 new recorded cases of the virus, 98 more than the previous Saturday's increase, according to data from the Arkansas Department of Health. The state added 4,963 new cases and 1,926 active, or currently infectious, cases in the past week. Active cases jumped 358 to 8,491 on Saturday after crossing 8,000 on Friday for the first time since Feb. 23, according to the data. However, no new deaths from covid-19 were reported for the third day in a row, keeping the death toll at 11,533. The Health Department recorded 16 new deaths of the virus in the past week. The number of Arkansans hospitalized with covid-19 dropped Thursday and Friday but rose by eight on Saturday, totaling 189. Even with the decreases, 35 more people were hospitalized Saturday than a week earlier. One person was admitted to intensive care with the virus, bringing the state's total to 27 Saturday, four more than a week earlier. The number of covid-19 patients on ventilators remained at nine for the third day in a row, according to Health Department data. On Saturday, 1,408 covid-19 vaccines were distributed in Arkansas, and 939 were booster shots. According to the data, 7,924 shots were given in the past week, 2,322 fewer than the previous week. According to Health Department data, 1,619,509 Arkansans are fully vaccinated against covid-19, and 680,839 booster shots have been given. Starting next week, Pfizer and Moderna covid-19 vaccines will be available for children between 6 months and 5 years of age, after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention gave the green light Saturday. Children ages 5 to 11 have been eligible for the shots since November.  Print Headline: Covid-19 cases rise by 708 for 1 day

        The Arkansas Senate Ethics Committee is scheduled to convene on Wednesday and Thursday, after the Senate Rules Committee appointed a temporary replacement for an ethics committee member. Senate Rules Committee Chairman James Sturch, R-Batesville, said Friday that the Senate Rules Committee on Thursday voted to appoint state Sen. David Wallace, R-Leachville, as the temporary replacement for a member of the Senate Ethics Committee. When a complaint is filed against a member of the Senate Ethics Committee, the state Senate's rules require the Senate Rules Committee to appoint a temporary replacement for the ethics committee member until the investigation of the complaint is completed, he said. "They did not disclose who the complaint is filed against to me or members of the Rules Committee," Sturch said in a text message. "We were just told it was a Republican member, therefore we appointed another majority member." Senate President Pro Tempore Jimmy Hickey, R-Texarkana, on Friday declined to comment on the matter. The Senate Ethics Committee's members include Republican Sens. Kim Hammer of Benton, Missy Irvin of Mountain View, Mark Johnson of Ferndale, Mat Pitsch of Fort Smith,and Dan Sullivan of Jonesboro, and Democratic Sens. Joyce Elliott of Little Rock, Stephanie Flowers of Pine Bluff and Clarke Tucker of Little Rock. In response to the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette's public records request seeking the identity of the Senate Ethics Committee member, who has been temporarily replaced, Senate Director/Secretary Ann Cornwell wrote Friday in an email, "It was handled by BLR [the Bureau of Legislative Research]." Hammer, who chairs the Senate Ethics Committee, said Friday in a written statement issued through the Bureau of Legislative Research that a meeting of the Senate Ethics Committee has been scheduled for Wednesday to begin at 9 a.m. in Room 309 in the state Capitol. The committee will take up a matter that has been presented to it under the Senate eules, he said. "To protect the integrity of the process and ensure that the matter is handled appropriately, at this time I am not at liberty to discuss any of the details of the matter," Hammer said. Asked whether he has been temporarily replaced as a member of the Senate Ethics Committee, Johnson said he was advised by legislative staff, on behalf of Hammer, not to answer that question. "Rules are about confidentiality prior to the committee review," he said in a text message. The Senate Ethics Committee also is scheduled to meet Thursday at 9 a.m. in Room 309 in the state Capitol, according to the General Assembly's website. Sen. Alan Clark, R-Lonsdale, on Friday declined to comment when asked about speculation in some state Capitol circles that a complaint has been filed against him with the Senate Ethics Committee. Asked whether the Senate Ethics Committee meetings would be open to the public or closed, Bureau of Legislative Research Director Marty Garrity said, "I would refer you to [Senate] rule 24.09(d) which provides that the public shall be allowed to observe the entire proceeding unless the committee is in executive session." In June of 2018, the state Senate approved an overhaul of its rules to create a committee on ethics, prohibit senators from certain activities involving conflicts of interest, and require more disclosure of other conflicts and their personal finances. The Senate's action came after federal investigations in the previous few years led to convictions of several former state lawmakers.  Print Headline: Temporary member chosen for ethics panel

         SYMONE MEETS VEEP Conway native and Rupaul's Drag Race Season 13 winner Symone got to spend time with Vice President Kamala Harris last week. Harris made a surprise appearance at the Capital Pride Festival in Washington, D.C., on June 12 and was joined onstage by Symone, who shared photos on Instagram of herself with the vice president and husband Douglas Emhoff. "Absolutely blown away y'all," Symone wrote. "I got to meet Kamala Harris and Douglas Emhoff today at the DC Pride. Thank you so much for this moment Madame Vice President and the lovely gifts! I love you DC!" Not only has she been rubbing shoulders with the vice president, Symone has added acting to her resume. She plays an out-of-drag character in "Bros," the gay rom-com feature film from writer-star Billy Eichner. "When I saw Symone, who I think is such a superstar, I thought, I want a place for Symone in 'Bros,'" Eichner told Entertainment Weekly earlier this month. "I was thinking of the roles we had and I didn't know if she'd be interested in playing a character that was out of drag, but I thought, why not use this as an opportunity?" Symone has a small role as an acquaintance of Bobby Leiber, who is played by Eichner, according to Entertainment Weekly. The film, directed by Nicholas Stoller and produced by Stoller and Judd Apatow, is set for release on Sept. 30. REALITY SHOW ARKIES Symone became famous from appearing on a reality show, now two other hopefuls with Arkansas connections are looking for a similar outcome. Scarlett Bentley, who grew up in Batesville and left Arkansas for San Diego, is a junior stewardess on the Parsifal III in season three of Bravo's "Below Deck Sailing Yacht," while Adam Riley of Fayetteville is among the survivalists competing for $500,000 in a remote valley in Labrador, Canada, on History Channel's "Alone." The 36-year-old Riley was 9 when he immigrated with his family to Florida from England, according to the show's page at history.com. After leaving high school and quitting his job as an alligator wrestler -- no, really, that's what it says -- he spent years exploring wild areas all over the world. He now works as a carpenter building custom tree houses in Arkansas. After four episodes, Riley is among eight left from the original 10 contestants still in the running for the $500,000 prize. Bentley was in marketing before working on chartered trips at sea and has two years yachting experience, according to bravotv.com. Drama has ensued since she joined the Parsifal III crew, according to the web site, and her relationship with the first mate could lead to trouble. "Below Deck Sailing Yacht" airs Mondays at 7 p.m. "Alone" airs Thursdays at 8 p.m. email: sclancy@adgnewsroom.com  Print Headline: State puts new stars on screens

         100 years ago June 19, 1922 BATESVILLE -- A company of local business people have bought out the Mack Hardy tailor shop in the Arlington hotel building and in addition to conducting a tailor shop will establish the first manufacturing fur garment shop ever operated in this city. The company will be operated under the name "Fashion Shop," and will manufacture women's furs from the raw pelts to the finished garments. There is an abundance of fur-bearing animals trapped in this section, many of which are valuable. These furs will be bought from the trappers and retail fur dealers, and after being made up will be sold to wholesale and retail merchants. 50 years ago June 19, 1972 JONESBORO -- Herbert Lenual Crabtree, 34, a former postal clerk at Nettleton Substation of the Jonesboro post office, was found innocent by a deferral court jury of five men and seven women here Friday on charges of embezzling $200. The jury deliberated only 10 minutes. Crabtree was arrested January 5, a day after postal authorities said he admitted to them in a signed statement that he had converted $200 of postal funds to his own use. ... Crabtree's attorney, Randy Ishmael of Jonesboro, said that Crabtree was, under the legal definition, insane at the time the government said he embezzled $200. ... On the day he was charged, Crabtree paid to the postal authorities $404, the amount of money that was listed as missing in a December 31 audit. 25 years ago June 19, 1997 HINDSVILLE -- About 50 rural Madison County residents Wednesday greeted a group searching for potential Northwest Arkansas landfill sites with a mix of suspicion and country cordiality but made sure their message was understood. "The people here don't want this landfill, and they're not going to let it happen," said Jerry Bolinger, who for 29 years has served as the Madison County treasurer. ... The consultants' favoring of prime Madison County farmland near Hindsville stirred the area's residents into activism. Only a week after learning of the consultants' findings, residents presented committee members Wednesday with maps showing sinkholes, wells, springs, ponds, cemeteries, wetlands and other features the consultants had not discovered in their research. Residents also presented petitions that they said contained several hundred signatures of people opposed to any landfill in Madison County. 10 years ago June 19, 2012 MAGNOLIA -- What began as a whim in 1990 has evolved into one of the main features of the Emerson Purple Hull Pea Festival. The 23rd annual World Championship Rotary Tiller Race has been scheduled at the festival for 2:30 p.m. June 30. Ordinary garden tillers and tillers modified for racing will be separated into categories and piloted down a 200-foot-long plowed track. Participants in the men's modified division will compete for a $1,000 cash prize. ... A $500 prize will be awarded to the winner of the women's modified division. ... In addition to the prize money available for racing, Prescott Raceway will present a $100 prize to the fastest time of all the heats.  Print Headline: Other days

         Contract renewed for superintendent The North Little Rock School Board unanimously approved renewing Superintendent Gregory Pilewski's contract with the district during its meeting Thursday night. Pilewski will have his contract extended from June 2022 to June 2024. Pilewski came to the district in August 2020 from the Queen Anne's County Public Schools in Maryland, where he was a deputy superintendent. The board also voted to change Pilewski's performance and incentive bonus. Polling sites get county panel's OK The Pulaski County Election Commission approved Glenview Community Center as an additional early voting site in North Little Rock. Glenview Community Center will now serve as an early voting site along with Laman Library. The Rose City Recreation Center will also now serve as an election day polling site. The changes will be in place for the city's special election for its sales tax referendum on Aug. 9 and will remain permanent. The decision comes after the Pulaski County Board of Election Commissioners eliminated 15 polling locations across the county in February. The change included removing the polling site at Glenview Community Center, which served as a voting location for many North Little Rock east side residents.

         Port agency board OKs pay increases Board members of the Little Rock Port Authority approved cost-of-living and merit pay increases for employees during a meeting Wednesday. The $72,000 amendment to the fiscal 2022 budget was approved in a voice vote without discussion by board members. The amendment included $50,000 for the port to operate the former Delta Dental building and approximately $20,000 for the pay increase, including benefits, for the rest of the year, Port Executive Director Bryan Day told board members. The base pay increase will be 2% with the possibility of up to an additional 2% merit increase. Utility rate-study contract approved The board of commissioners of Central Arkansas Water at a meeting on Thursday approved a rate study contract with the consulting firm Raftelis for $157,860. The purpose of the rate study is "to establish sufficient revenues to cover utility operating costs through 2027 and long-term capital costs," according to board documents. The motion was approved in a voice vote. Mayor, employees mark Juneteenth Little Rock Mayor Frank Scott Jr. recognized today's Juneteenth holiday in a video message released Friday. "While it may take years to see progress, we trust there is a brighter future and better days ahead, and we keep moving forward," Scott said. Scott also noted that on Monday, Little Rock city employees will observe Juneteenth as a paid holiday for the first time. "I'm encouraging my team and everyone in the community to attend Juneteenth events or to spend time doing their part to acknowledge our history and commit to building a better future," he said. Juneteenth at zoo discounts planned The Little Rock Zoo will offer discounted admissions on Monday in observance of Juneteenth, according to a recent zoo newsletter. All admissions will be $2 off. "Our observance of Juneteenth is a natural fit with our diversity values at the Zoo. We hope you can join us," the newsletter said.  Print Headline: Port agency board OKs pay increases

         North Little Rock Electric announced Friday it will be moving its customer service department in the fall and will permanently close the drive-thru services at the end of August. Jill Ponder, the electric company's director of business operations, said that closing the drive-thru was partially because of the upcoming change of location. "We've always planned to start phasing this out. Our business model doesn't need a drive through anymore," said Ponder. The city of North Little Rock is planning to redevelop the building that houses the electric company -- located at 120 Main St. -- in the fall, according to a news release. According to Ponder, less than 7% of North Little Rock Electric customers use the drive-thru. The electric company said there are five alternate ways to pay a bill without payment processing fees. Customers can pay via mail, phone, an app, online or through MoneyGram, according to a news release. Ponder said most of these options are relatively new and more customers are choosing to utilize them instead of a drive-thru. "Hopefully we don't upset a lot of customers with this," said Ponder. "There are other ways to pay that might be more helpful to them. They could use a MoneyGram at Kroger or Walmart that might be closer for them rather than drive to our building." She said the best of the five options, however, was the app. According to her, the app is secure, convenient and allows users to view their bill and pay it.

         Jacksonville police were investigating Saturday after officers discovered a man shot to death late Friday, according to a news release from the department. Police responded around 11:35 p.m. to a report at 620 S. First St. where they discovered a man who had been shot and was unresponsive. Officers determined that the man, who was not identified in the release, had died from his wounds prior to their arrival. No further information was provided about the killing, but the investigation is ongoing, the release states.  Print Headline: Jacksonville police investigate death

         MEMPHIS -- Work has started in Tennessee on a $141 million project to build travel lanes and a roundabout intersection on the Interstate 55 interchange near a heavily traveled bridge connecting Memphis to Arkansas. Lane closures began Monday at the I-55 and Crump interchange close to downtown Memphis and near one of two bridges that cross the Mississippi River from the city, said Mike Welch, a regional director of operations for the Tennessee Department of Transportation. I-55 runs north-south, from Chicago to Louisiana, and it is one of two major U.S. interstates that travel through Memphis -- the east-west Interstate 40 is the other. Motorists have been warned of lane closures during the project, which officials said is estimated to be completed in 2025. Improvements to the interchange at I-55 and Crump Boulevard -- also known as U.S. 78 -- include new travel lanes for main interstate traffic, TDOT said. That will eliminate the use of "single-lane, low-speed ramps" to continue on I-55, the department said. A roundabout intersection will replace the existing cloverleaf interchange and the I-55 river bridge deck will undergo repairs, the department said. Nashville-based Bell & Associates Construction won the contract with the lowest bid at about $141.2 million, TDOT said.  Print Headline: Work gets underway on I-55 interchange

         HIGHFILL -- A land rush in western Benton County is making Northwest Arkansas National Airport officials nervous. "They're not coming out this way because the airport is out here. The reason they're out here is the terrain is conducive to development," said Philip Taldo, an airport board member and Realtor. "That's why it's not all going east. You get around the lake, you get around the hills. South is the same thing. This is the most obvious place to put an airport, and it's the most obvious place to put houses." Most of the surrounding land was used for farming when the airport opened in November 1998. In the years since, towns near the airport have expanded their geographic area and their populations. Highfill's population in the 2000 census was 379; in 2020, it hit 1,587. Centerton increased from 2,146 in people in 2000 to 17,792. Cave Springs grew from 1,103 to 5,495. Bentonville recorded 19,730 residents in 2000 and 54,164 by the 2020 census. Land near the airport grows more expensive by the day, an appraiser told airport authority board members recently. "The prices are high. Real high. And, what we've been valuing them at is reflective of the market here but, as those sales continue to come down this way, it's going to continue to cost you more and more per acre," Stephen Cosby, an appraiser, told airport officials at a recent meeting. Cosby said Northwest National reminds him of an airport at Savannah, Ga., that was built several years ago in what was then a rural area west of the city. Now, that airport is surrounded by development, including residential subdivisions. "That is happening here," he said. "We're seeing it occur just over the last two years." Cosby said a planned new road to the airport will make the area even more attractive to residential development. "Infrastructure is a huge thing," he said. North of the airport, Centerton is approving subdivisions at three and four lots per acre and lots are selling at $35,000 to $40,000, up from $25,000 to $30,000 in just the last couple of years. It's cheapest to buy raw land. If any improvements are made to the property by an owner or developer, such as running water and sewer lines or streets or subdividing the property into lots, those costs are typically added to the purchase price and passed on to a buyer, increasing the cost to buy the land. "Once it gets developed with an incompatible use or just gets developed, period, it has those improvement costs that we're going to have to acquire," said Aaron Burkes, the airport's chief executive officer. Airport officials would rather have industrial neighbors than residential because there are generally fewer noise complaints. Burkes said he has talked with several developers who are planning warehouses or other industrial projects around the airport. "That is exactly what we want. That property sets a precedent for that zoning, and we get some of these projects very compatible with the airport," Burkes said. BUYING OR SELLING Burkes said Northwest Arkansas is a seller's market, in his opinion, but plans are to continue to buy land the airport thinks it will need as it becomes available rather than exercising eminent domain -- the power of the government to take private property and convert it into public use after just compensation to the property owners. "It really is something that's going to be incremental, acquisitions probably over a couple of decades," he said. "I think it's the least impactful on our neighbors to do it as all voluntary transactions." Airport staff are working with their neighbors to protect the airport's interests without having to buy as much land. Mike Johnson, airport board member from Fayetteville, said the best approach would be a combination of working with the county and the surrounding municipalities on zoning and other protections while also buying land when the opportunity presents itself. "It has to happen now. We wait five or 10 or 15 years, we're toast," Johnson said. "The expense of buying and the hate and discontent of any additional noise becomes a tough problem." Airport officials recently talked about ways to make sure buyers of land near the airport get fair warning of higher noise levels and any property restrictions during the sale. To keep the noise down, touch-and-go landing practice is not allowed at night and plans were changed to shorten the maximum length of future runways. Airport officials would also like to see cities require more noise insulation in houses near the airport. PLANNING XNA officials authorized land use and noise studies in December. Airport officials say anything above 65 decibels is problematic because it's not compatible with residential areas. Officials said the Federal Aviation Administration could revisit that threshold as new planes are required to be quieter. Normal urban areas typically have a decibel level around 55. Bentonville is the only city with an overlay district related to the airport. The ordinance restricts or prohibits some uses of properties and imposes limitations on height, glare and lighting. Certain zones also require extra sound dampening measures and avigation easements. The stated purpose of the ordinance is to provide protection to people and property on the ground and to protect the airport from the encroachment of noncompatible land uses that may interfere with the safe operation of the airport. "Our hope is that we can get the other municipalities to adopt something similar and protect that area," Burkes said. Centerton is where most of the new subdivisions are being added, he said. Airport officials adopted height hazard zoning to protect the airspace around the airport, but they can't control land use on the ground. Centerton Mayor Bill Edwards said the city and developers have a good relationship with the airport and are willing to work with the airport on noise mitigation measures and communicating with potential homebuyers. "The projects that we've had, we've had a couple come through so far, and they have rezoned them, but we can't make the developers put an avigation easement on there. But we've asked, and the developers have been very willing to do that because they want people to know they're in a flight path, too," Edwards said. "That just protects the airport. It protects the city and lets everybody know you're in a flight path." An avigation easement transfers certain property rights from a property owner to an airport owner including right of overflight in the airspace above or in the vicinity of a particular property. It also includes the right to create such noise or other effects as may result from the lawful operation of aircraft in such airspace and the right to remove any obstructions to such overflight. Basically, an avigation easement permits aircraft approaching an airport to fly low above private property. Edwards said airport officials have met with Centerton, Highfill and Bentonville leaders to educate them about the airport's needs and explain what projects they have in the pipeline that may affect neighboring residents. Mead & Hunt, the airport's longtime consultant, is working on off-airport land use planning and completing necessary noise studies now. They're expected to delineate the noisy areas around the airport including the area that would be impacted by the future second runway on the east side. Ryk Dunkelberg with Mead & Hunt said he's found noise and land use compatibility are the biggest hindrances to any airport development. Dunkelberg has over four decades working in aviation noise mitigation planning and has received national awards for airport noise mitigation, abatement and management. "Remember, the reason we are interested in compatible land use is to protect the health, safety and welfare of citizens living around the airport to make sure they have the quiet use and enjoyment of their property, number one," Dunkelberg said. "Number two, we want to make sure that the airport is protected so that we can develop." Burkes said the airport has been sued over noise issues, but not in the last four years or so. He doesn't expect the streak to continue. "We're at that precipice. We are now going to have development all around us," he said. "It's natural that it's going to happen, and this next five years is going to be dramatic."  Print Headline: NWA airport officials rattled by land rush

         Virginia Young, the mayor of Sherwood, was elected president of the Arkansas Municipal League for the 2022-23 term. The election on Friday capped a three-day convention of the Municipal League at the Statehouse Convention Center in Little Rock. The league is a service and advocacy organization for 499 municipalities in the state. Before she became mayor in 2007, Young was Sherwood city clerk and treasurer for six years. She began working for Sherwood city government in 1986, when she joined the finance department. Young, 58, is running for reelection as Sherwood mayor in the November election. Sherwood's mayor is elected to four-year terms. In her acceptance speech as Arkansas Municipal League president Friday, Young thanked the outgoing president, Berryville Mayor Tim McKinney, for his work during the past year, and the league membership foe electing her to be president for the coming term. "Thank you for your vote of confidence," she said. "I look forward to working with each of you. We were not designed to go through this journey solo. It takes all of us in this room for each of us to do our jobs. We were elected by the residents of our communities to operate in our leadership capacities with ethics, knowledge and wisdom, and we continue to grow daily in that." Other officers elected at the 88th annual convention for 2022-2023 were Cave City Mayor Jonas Anderson, first vice president; McCrory Mayor Doyle Fowler, District 1 vice president; North Little Rock City Clerk Diane Whitbey, District 2 vice president; Greenwood Mayor Doug Kinslow, District 3 vice president; and Crossett Mayor Crystal Marshall, District 4 vice president. The convention included sessions on the state's opioid litigation and settlements, protecting municipalities' IT infrastructure from cyberthreats, and local strategies for decreasing crime.

        North Little Rock police late Friday arrested a man who reportedly had a stolen gun in his vehicle, despite his assurances that the weapon was legally his, according to an arrest report. An officer stopped Julius Ford, 21, of Pine Bluff, about 11:30 p.m. at 3612 John F. Kennedy Blvd., reporting that Ford was driving carelessly. The officer reported smelling marijuana and had Ford leave the vehicle so he could search it. Ford reportedly said that there was a gun in the car but "it was clean." However, a search of the vehicle located a gun under the driver's seat that had been reported stolen. There was also a small jar of suspected marijuana in the passenger seat. Ford is charged with theft by receiving, a felony, and a misdemeanor drug possession charge.  Print Headline: Police: Stolen gun leads to NLR arrest

         Little Rock Police on Saturday were investigating a fatal wreck that killed two people Friday night, a department spokesman said. Around 9:15 p.m. Friday, officers responding to a collision in the area of West 12th Street and South Rodney Parham Road found two vehicles that had collided while westbound on 12th Street before coming to rest against a building at 7400 Kanis Road, Sgt. Eric Barnes wrote in a news release Saturday morning. Citizens had reported two people were trapped in one of the vehicles, and two people in a Mercedes-Benz were declared dead at the scene. The Mercedes-Benz driver has yet to be identified and was taken to the Arkansas Crime Lab, but the deceased passenger was identified as Larry Brewer, 47, of Conway. The driver of the other vehicle involved, a Dodge Avenger, was identified as Tavarne Williams, 43, of Little Rock. She received medical treatment, but her wounds were not considered life-threatening. Officers were still working to reconstruct the crash based on measurements and observations from the scene, but preliminary information indicated the driver of the Mercedes-Benz lost control, striking the Dodge, and both vehicles then left the road, Barnes wrote. Barnes could not yet say if the vehicles were racing at the time of the collision, something that will be determined during the investigation. Also Friday, a Stuttgart woman was killed in a single-vehicle crash in rural Arkansas County, according to a preliminary fatality report from Arkansas State Police. Marsha Snyder, 71, was passing a vehicle on U.S. 63 just after 4:50 p.m. and attempting to get back in the northbound lane when she lost control of the 2004 Jeep Patriot. The Jeep left the road and traveled into a field, overturning and throwing Snyder from the vehicle. She was pronounced dead on the scene by the Arkansas County coroner, the report states. The trooper investigating the crash reported that the weather was clear and the road was dry at the time.  Print Headline: LR police investigating double traffic fatality

         In response to a common need for leadership skills in communities and organizations, the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff Student Government Association launched a six-week Freshman Leadership Academy. Under the leadership of the 2021-2022 SGA President Leon Jones III, the spring 2022 student leadership program enabled 17 students to explore their leadership potential. The program content was tailored after one of the world's most respected leadership models: The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership. The experience focused on transformational leadership and enhancing the students' leadership capacity and capability on campus as they prepared for leadership positions in the future, according to a news release. The initial academy concluded with the spring 2022 session after the participants formally presented their solutions to campus issues commonly faced by first-year students. The academy students included Chloe Brackens, Justin Braylock, Xavier Brown, Dasjah Daniels, Vivica Dupree, Janiya Fellows, Destiny Guillory, J'Keile Hadley, Aaliyah Handy, Kamiah Hendrix-Turner, Kandance Jimmerson, Hezekiah Kirkwood, Jada Sharp, Freddiemae Thompson, Stephen Tillman, Tyra Walker, Tanayia Wells. FLA facilitators included the SGA president Leon Jones III, Alexandria Slater, a UAPB senior in the Human Development and Family Studies program, and Frank D. Dorsey II, associate dean of students for activities. The UAPB Freshman Leadership Academy builds on the research and framework developed by James Kouzes and Barry Posner entitled The Student Leadership Challenge: Five Practices for Becoming an Exemplary Leader.

         Doug Dorris is finally "graduating" from the White Hall School District (again). That's the term the superintendent and 1970 White Hall High alumnus used to announce his retirement from a 46-year career in education last November. The 70-year-old's final day is June 30. "I'm going to spend more time with my family and grandkids," Dorris said Monday, a day before his final regular board meeting in five years as superintendent. "I've got two daughters and three grandchildren, one in White Hall and two in Russellville. [I plan to] spend more time with them and maybe not have to answer the phone as much." Those future plans include gardening and working in his yard. Dorris lives within the same 2- to 3-mile radius in which he grew up. "I try to grow everything in the world, but the last couple of years, the squirrels had more fun than I have," he said. UNFINISHED BUSINESS In a sense, Dorris' work won't be done once retirement day comes. He has agreed to work on a volunteer basis to see the district's approximate $25 million building project across all six of its campuses through to completion. The project, a result of a 2.9-mill increase voters favored in January 2020, ranks at or near the top of Dorris' accomplishments in the five years he's led his hometown district, in his words. "I think our biggest selling point was when I talked to the Redfield City Council and they came out in support of the millage," Dorris said. "I knew we had a good chance. That night was just as exciting as anything I had been through. "They announced we had won Redfield by 100 votes. I said, 'We're going to win this thing.' You could feel the momentum, and the people of the White Hall School District came out and pushed hard for that. The board was behind that 100%." Scott Ray, a 16-year board trustee and 1981 White Hall High graduate, remembered Dorris pouring his soul into getting a twice-defeated measure passed on the what was hoped was a third-time charm. "Doug was important in getting the millage passed," said Ray, a banker and caterer. "We went and met with parents in Redfield one night. His leadership and trust in the community were key. The people who were never for the millage, we saw them that night. It was a turnaround night. I think they saw that he was not there to work against them, but to work for the better of every child of the White Hall School District." Ray saw the measure go down in the polls twice before but he realized that Dorris' connections to White Hall helped the measure gain more traction. "We added to it," Dorris said of the language in the proposal. "The difference was that every school in the district got touched by the millage increase. We spread it out, and all six campuses had something done with it." One of the additions was approved during Tuesday's board meeting, when Dorris revealed every exit door on each campus will be equipped with a security camera and a lock only faculty members can open. The measure was not a response to last month's mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, Dorris said. "We decided years ago we were going to start doing upgrades on every building," he said. "All of our elementary schools, every exit door will have a camera, and you have to be buzzed in or have a key fob to get in. All elementary schools will be completely safe from outside intrusions of people coming in. The middle school has been like that for some time." WHSD EVOLUTION ACCORDING TO DORRIS There was a time when the White Hall School District was on the opposite side of the growth spectrum. "I go back to first grade. Back then, kindergarten wasn't required," said Dorris, whose father served on the school board. "Even then, our facilities were well-kept. They were old. They were bad old, but we kept on. You always had enough, but when [then-Superintendent] Julius Brown came aboard, he had a vision," Dorris recalled. "We didn't have much money in the district. As a matter of fact, White Hall was one of the poorest districts in the state of Arkansas. You had to really ration things out, and then White Bluff [a power plant in Redfield] came about. That's what started the building phase." By building phase, Dorris referred to the construction of present-day schools including White Hall High, which opened in the 1980-81 school year. Dorris began working in the district the next school year, after spending five years teaching and coaching at Watson Chapel Junior High School. "I was very happy being a coach, but there came an opportunity to be an assistant principal, so I was at the high school for 10 years, and then I officially retired for the first time to go to Trinity Episcopal School, and it closed down that year," Dorris said. "Luckily, the middle school job came open, and I went back there." Then in 2017, Ray talked Dorris into accepting what was meant to be a one-year appointment to succeed Larry Smith as superintendent. "Things were going so good at the time, we agreed I'd stay another year," Dorris said. "The next thing I know, it's five years down the road. The deal was, my wife, she retired before this job ever came open, and I was going to give her a year of peace and quiet to herself, and this extended out five years. "This is just a perfect dream that happened at the right time." KEY DECISIONS Dorris -- and every other superintendent across America -- was faced with making tough and sometimes unpopular decisions in navigating school districts through the coronavirus pandemic, which began in March 2020. "Anybody that lived through covid, this changed your whole life," Dorris said. "What really helped us out when it first happened was, we shut down school, the last nine weeks. You had a lot of guidance coming to you from federal and state [governments]. As time went on, the state and federal wanted to back off their decision and make it go local. I remember lying in bed thinking, 'What do I need to do to assure the safety of our kids?' Overall, you had to make a decision for all the kids." Dorris put in a mask mandate for the district that some parents challenged through petitions. Those efforts to overturn the mandate were unsuccessful, but Dorris eventually loosened the restrictions as cases of coronavirus trended downward during the 2021-22 school year. "I could never see myself [realizing] that a kid ended up dying and I didn't try to do what I needed to do," he said. "That's the reason I try to base it on what was the best decision for the White Hall School District." NEXT IN CHARGE Gary Williams will take over for Dorris on July 1 after leading the Crossett district for seven years. The 29-year education veteran has stayed in touch with board members and their outgoing leader through constant visits to board meetings since his appointment in January. "I'm struck by his love and devotion to the White Hall School District and the community of White Hall," Williams said of Dorris. "I've had the chance to be with him in interactions, and you can tell the impact he has made on the district. His impact and longevity are pretty amazing." So is the growth of a district Dorris has witnessed firsthand, from the time he began grade school to the time he "graduated," in his own words, to retirement. "White Hall has changed a great deal, and a lot of it has been for the better," he said. "My senior year, we graduated 66 kids. That was in 1970. You go all the way back in time to this year, and we graduated 217-plus."  Print Headline: Dorris to leave mark on White Hall district

         I wish we knew more about Jimmy Ward. A popular entertainer in Little Rock at the turn of the 20th century, Ward was well-known then and obviously well-liked, judging from the many positive things said about him in the local newspapers. He was also mentally ill. Having spent time at the state mental hospital, he wrote a detailed account of that experience which, unintentionally perhaps, left little doubt as to his precarious mental state. James Cook Ward was born Dec. 10, 1867, in Little Rock, the son of James W. and Adeline Ward. We know nothing of his education; however, he was verbally gifted, judging from his publications that included works of poetry, a novel, plus his asylum memoirs. Ward was first and foremost a showman, probably a street entertainer most of the time. Known as Whistling Jim, his acts involved singing, whistling, bird imitations, dancing stunts and wild costuming. He was, one writer noted, "a human mockingbird." On one occasion a Little Rock minister hired Ward to provide sound effects for his sermon. Fred Allsopp, an owner of the Arkansas Gazette and author of numerous books on Arkansas topics, included a poem on Whistling Jim in his book "Arkansia": With oddest clothes, a wide-brimmed hat Big specs and white goatee He played his part with perfect art This musical grandee. Allsopp also noted Ward's reputation as a banjoist: A banjo was his orchestra His theater -- the street His hat served as an office box His audience -- all he'd meet. It is unclear why and when Whistling Jim was sent to what was known as the Arkansas Lunatic Asylum, ultimately staying for 181 days. We know he was released before 1902, because that is the year he published his book, "Experiences as a Lunatic." Ward wrote that he was planning to travel to New York City to find theatrical work when "my mind commenced playing a sort of a see-saw game with me." This problem arose after Ward had an intense religious conversion, replete with visions. "People were saying that I had gone crazy over religion," he wrote. Ward does not record the name of "a friend" who convinced him to go to the Lunatic Asylum for an examination. Accompanied by two friends, Ward's carriage soon traveled the three miles west of Little Rock to the Asylum, a large red brick structure situated atop a hill just west of the modern UAMS campus. Although the state adopted legislation in 1873 to create a state mental facility, the early efforts were stymied by the Brooks-Baxter War of 1874, which brought an end to Reconstruction. The Asylum opened in 1883. Upon arrival at the facility, Ward was directed by his friends to go into an examining room and await the doctor. However, he no sooner walked into the room than "slam! bang! clang! -- a double iron door closed behind me. I was locked up in a lunatic asylum." After looking around a bit, Ward later wrote: "I soon saw that I was in the midst of all kinds of crazy people." Ward's book provides one of the few firsthand accounts of life in the Asylum. He was taken aback by the patients with the most severe afflictions: "I saw patients at that asylum who were going through all kinds of contortions with their faces and fingers." "One patient," Ward wrote, "was often talking to himself about Free Masonry and the Bible and also often yelled out something about the Jay Gould party [railroad tycoons] doing this, that, and the other." He concluded, "I saw one patient who used to sometimes spin around just like he was a top." It was, he mused, "a mighty ocean of crazydom." During his first night of confinement Ward had a vision -- he was visited by a talking star who called him "son." A few weeks later he developed another relationship with a heavenly body: the sun. Perhaps his most involved paranormal experience involved mental telepathy. One day while Ward was sitting on a bench in a public space, he heard a voice calling his name. When he finally acknowledged the disembodied voice, he was convinced that Junius Howe, the manager of a summer opera company in Little Rock, was calling his name using mental telepathy. Ward made no effort to camouflage neither his most severe mental challenges nor his poor behavior. At first he took great pains to destroy dozens of mattresses. Admitting that he lost control, Ward wrote: "Oh, I went to pieces. So did every piece of furniture or any other article belonging to the asylum go to pieces when I got my hands, mouth or feet onto it." He concluded, "I kicked every spittoon in football fashion all over the ward -- my spittoon extermination." It was only a matter of a few days after his arrival that Ward was segregated in a secure "strong room." As his violence continued, Ward spent more time in strong rooms, and shackled. "I venture to say that I never spent as much as 30 days out of 181 days without handcuffs and ankle straps." Whistling Jim was an obvious flight risk, and it was only a matter of time before he made an escape. Using a large block of wood, Ward was able to knock a hole in a wall. He ran into town in an attempt to sneak onto a departing freight car, but foolishly decided to stop by the Gazette to cancel an advertisement he had bought. He was recognized and held for the police. Ward's morale sank a bit after being returned to the Asylum. He stopped eating regularly, weighing 110 pounds when he was released. He was also transferred to Ward 9, the "incurable ward." Eventually Ward was able to visit his parents at home. He convinced them that he was well, but would return to the Asylum if he relapsed. That was a good decision. In July 1902, Ward married Miss Seaburn Harris of Hazen in Prairie County. The couple had seven children. Marriage must have agreed with Ward, for he avoided any additional mental episodes -- or at least was able to carry on a normal life. He gained fame toward the end of his life as the beloved announcer for the Arkansas Travelers baseball team. When he died in June 1927, Ward's funeral was well attended. Among the pallbearers were a former mayor, several aldermen, and a federal magistrate. Tom Dillard is a historian and retired archivist living in Hot Spring County.

         PRAIRIE GROVE -- The home farm, Rio Flora, is much more than a hobby for Annie Sales. She wanted to make a commitment to stay home with her son. The new farm, which is made up of multiple garden spots located in a neighborhood in the middle of Prairie Grove, has made this possible, while at the same time enriching her family's lives, she said. Sales has always been a gardener, helping in her grandmother's garden growing up and volunteering with lots of community gardens. But now, for the first time, she and her husband, Max Rowdon, and their young son, Rio, the namesake for the business, have their own space to grow vegetables, fruits, flowers and other plants. "My heart is in native plants and permaculture," Sales said. "The idea is to grow food in a more natural way, to mimic the natural system," Sales said. Sales has a master's degree in fluvial geomorphology, or environmental science, from Missouri State University. Her thesis studied urban recovery and how to create a more naturalized feeling in a city. Her husband lived in Houston and New Orleans growing up, and they lived in New Orleans before making the decision to move closer to her parents in Springfield, Mo. Sales said she visited Fayetteville while in college and liked the area, so they began looking in Northwest Arkansas for a place to live. They bought their home in Prairie Grove on Parks Street in fall of 2020, after looking at many houses on the market. The lot is about three-fourths of an acre, and Sales said she started doing what she could while her husband began working as director of sales for Arsaga's. The primary goal, she said, is to feed their family first and then get the opportunity to teach others about home gardens. "I think it's empowering to know you can grow your own food in your own backyard," she said. When they moved in, the house only had grass, boxwoods and hostas, Sales said. Slowly, Sales started turning parts of the back and front yards into garden areas with one limiting factor. The property has beautiful, older trees that shade parts of the back and front yards. The sunny areas are being used for vegetables and she's exploring more shade tolerant plants for the shady areas. Sales did most of the work to build a greenhouse for starter vegetable plants and has been selling those at the Prairie Grove Farmers Market. She hopes to be able to sell native perennial plants and berry bushes at the farmers market in the fall. The family's main garden is located in the sunniest part of the backyard and has plants that include tomatoes, peppers, strawberries and blueberries, cabbage, broccoli, garlic, potatoes and celery. Other plants in her yard include onions, elderberry bushes, radishes and beets. She has a flower patch and may sell fresh flowers at the farmers market in the future, depending on how many flowers the plants produce. The couple has planted fruit trees, berry bushes and flowering plants to provide food for critters. She calls one shaded area foodscaping because it has edible plants mixed in with flowering plants. "We want it to look beautiful," Sales said. They want to restore native prairies in a couple of areas, are working to eradicate evasive plants and eventually want to get bees. Another section in the backyard has plants that can be used for medicinal purposes. Sales also makes lotions for her family using her plants. "It's a lot of hard work," she said, but very rewarding because Rio is involved and is learning and working right along with her throughout the day. The couple, along with help from a friend who lives with them, does all work by hand for the gardens and grows everything naturally without the use of synthetic pesticides. They use rain barrels to catch rainwater for their plants and so far this year, with all the rainfall, they've been able to water everything from their rain barrels, which hold 900 gallons of water. She plans to install more rain barrels to help during dry spells. Sales said the couple recycles everything "over and over" and repurposes materials. They have five hens to provide eggs for the family and use the chickens as their "composting machines." The chicken coop is rotated around the yard. Once it's moved to a new location, that area is the next garden spot. The big project this summer, Sales said, is to prepare the front yard for more plants. They are covering the ground with cardboard to kill weeds and will cover that with wood chips that come from the city of Fayetteville. "We get a load of woodchips every week," she said. She said this is all part of building up the soil. Wood chips and lots of compost are good for the soil, she noted. They will come back next year and plant in the front yard to make it "more showy and beautiful," she added. Sales said she's been extremely thankful to be able to stay home and work on their gardens with Rio. "He's so independent and wants to help us as much as he can," she said. She's also appreciated the support from her neighbors. They've been curious about what's going in the yard, and she's been happy for them to drop by and ask her questions about it. "Everyone needs that communication," she said. She said she welcomes people to stop by when she's outside and ask her about Rio Flora and get advice on growing backyard (and front yard) gardens.

         LINCOLN -- For the second year in a row, the Lincoln School Board has approved a $2,000 raise to the base pay for certified employees. The board, at its April 18 meeting, also approved a 3% raise for classified employees, compared to a 2% raise approved last year. The new pay schedule will be effective for the 2022-23 school year. The base salary for a new teacher with a bachelor's degree and no experience will be $40,000, according to Superintendent Mary Ann Spears. The cost for the salary increases will be $220,000 for certified staff and $30,000 for classified staff. "This will get us a little more competitive as we recruit teachers," Spears told board members in April. Following the vote, board member Kenneth Albright immediately made a motion to add a $2,000 stipend to Spears' contract in recognition of her doctoral degree. "Thank you, guys," Spears responded in surprise. "That's very nice." Spears has been with Lincoln since July 2006 and served as superintendent since July 2013. She earned her doctoral degree in educational leadership from Arkansas Tech. During the board's May meeting, Spears said the district will purchase its two leased buses for $80,000 each, compared to buying new buses for about $130,000 each, and will lease two more buses for $19,500 per year with a three-year contract. The district's April financial report shows that the district has used 73% of its budget with two months left in the fiscal year. Spears said she hopes the district will be able to carry over enough balance to allow the district to deposit money into its building fund. The food service budget has a balance of around $300,000, and that money will be used to upgrade kitchen equipment and make other improvements. Spears said the district has many restrictions on how this money can be used. School celebrations at the May meeting included recognition of the track team, girls softball team and boys soccer team for their outstanding seasons. Gina McClellan, the district's English as a Second Language coordinator, recognized students who achieved the Arkansas Seal of Bi-Literacy for studying and attaining proficiency in two or more languages. McClellan said one student achieved this seal in 2021, with 10 students receiving the seal this year, and seven of those also being additionally recognized with the Global Seal of Bi-Literacy. The students recognized at the meeting for the seal: Aleah Alonzo, Chelsea Cardenas, Ashanti Pena, Sarahi Hernandez, Luis Calvillo, Brianna Avellaneda, Dianna Avellaneda, Jobany Madera, Federico Madera and Gonzalo Perez. Of the 780 students in Arkansas who achieved the goal for the 2021-22 school year, 10 of these came from Lincoln, McClellan said. "The students chose to do this. It's quite a bit of work," McClellan said. Spears said she is waiting to receive final costs of building a baseball/softball complex at the high school campus. It appears the cost will be around $1.8 million to $2 million for the build. "We'll get the final numbers and make a decision," Spears said. The district is also waiting to receive approval from the city for a greenhouse for the high school.  Print Headline: Lincoln School Board OKs teacher raises

         GREENWOOD -- The city council expects to approve a contract soon to extend water service to 36 acres recently annexed at the northwest corner of Arkansas 10 Spur and U.S. 71. Mayor Doug Kinslow said June 8 the James Fork Regional Water District, a rural water association, is working with the city to sell the water rights. He expressed hope a contract will be available for the City Council to consider during a special meeting, or its next regular meeting July 11. The City Council approved annexing the 36 acres April 4. It covers six parcels owned by Jacob Burton of MJE Construction and is planned to be a mixed-use development called the Curve. Sonny Bell, the city's planning director, has said the city needs to acquire the water rights to provide the Curve property water and fire protection services. The ordinance the City Council approved to annex this property says the city would extend these and other necessary urban services to the property within "a reasonable period of time." Cheryl Garner, a Realtor with the Fort Smith-based Keller Williams Platinum Realty who's working with Burton to market the property, said commercial development essentially can't happen without utilities such as water and sewer, in addition to the ability for fire suppression. The Curve has several projects pending development on the property that can't move forward until the city secures these water rights. "You always run the risk that a project will not move forward at all if you delay the timing of that project, and they look to where there's a more favorable location with regard to utilities," Garner said. Garner has said the Curve is planned to be the site of developments such as multifamily buildings, multistory commercial buildings, restaurants, a high-end convenience story and a boutique hotel, as well as a new, larger facility for the Sebastian County library in Greenwood. The Original Offer and Discussions The City Council voted to table a proposal to acquire the water rights for the Curve property April 4 pending further discussion with the James Fork Regional Water District. The proposal would've allowed the city to purchase the rights for $79,112 contingent on the annexation of the property, and a 20-year extension of the city's water purchase contract with the district with an agreed upon water amount and purchase cost. It also called for the city to purchase certain district customers along Center, Rockside, Shady, and Hillcrest streets, which are adjacent to the annexed property, within five years at an agreed upon price and subject to the annexation of this property. The city suggested the district separate the purchase of the rights for the Curve property from those of the other water users, which amounts to 53 customers, at a meeting June 6, Kinslow said. This was done both to expedite development for the Curve property and uncertainty as to whether that other property will be annexed within five years. Jeremy Shores of the Van Buren-based firm Hawkins-Weir Engineers calculated the cost to acquire the water rights for those 53 users at $214,000. "We really wanted them to separate the two issues, let us settle on Burton's property, and then come back later with a letter of intent of some sort, an attorney's here so whatever that might look like, to say, 'We still are going to pursue these other users, but not today,'" Kinslow said. Donnie Sandifer, general manager for the water district, confirmed Wednesday the district board met June 7 and still wants to work with the city on water rights. The district also provided Greenwood figures to purchase the rights for the Curve and the 53 other customers separately, according to Sandifer. "They wanted some figures to what we would expect or hope to get," Sandifer said. "So they've got them, and now we're just kind of waiting to hear back from them to see what their response is." He declined to say what the prices were. []  Print Headline: Negotiation underway to bring water to planned Greenwood development

         A team of AmeriCorps members are spending the summer helping Northwest Arkansas hunger relief organizations provide fresh produce to those in need. Cobblestone Farms, a nonprofit farm in Fayetteville, received an AmeriCorps grant for a team of 11 volunteers to spend 12 weeks working in Northwest Arkansas, according to Executive Director Kelton Hayes. The farm doesn't need that many corps members working 40 hours a week. So the nonprofit is sharing the workers with organizations that have a similar mission of addressing food insecurity, including the Northwest Arkansas Food Bank, Samaritan Community Center, Appleseeds Teaching Farm, St. James Baptist Church Food Pantry and Mount Comfort Presbyterian Church, he said. Hayes said he believes in collaboration. "You can go fast alone, but we can go far together," he said. "We know there is a lot to be done in our community, so why would we not work with any other organization that is either specifically working on food insecurity or wanting to make our community a better place." Corps team members have divided into groups of two and three and are serving three-week rotations at each organization May 5 through Aug. 5, Hayes said. The corps members are helping organizations during the busiest part of the gardening season and providing nonprofits with the staff to expand their operations in some cases, program directors said. The 11 volunteers are taking on tasks ranging from garden chores -- such as planting and harvesting vegetables -- to helping distribute food. The helpers are part of the National Civilian Community Corps of AmeriCorps. The federally funded program allows 18- to 26-year-old volunteers to spend periods of 10 to 11 months serving in the areas of energy conservation, infrastructure, urban and rural development, and disaster services, according to an AmeriCorps spokesperson. HELPING COBBLESTONE The team serving at Cobblestone Farms is based in Aurora, Colo., and spent its first two, 12-week sessions building and restoring homes in Houston to help with recovery from Hurricane Harvey of 2017 and the ice storms of February 2021, said team leader Kara Neal of Great Falls, Mont. Team members serve 1,700 direct hours as well as 80 individual service hours during their months of service, Neal said. All their expenses are paid, and they receive a small stipend while serving, she said. They also receive an education stipend of $6,000 when they complete their term of service, she said. Some team members are fresh out of high school, while others are college students or graduates, she said. Neal said she has been working in the gardens at Samaritan Community Center in Rogers. The gardens provide fresh produce for the center's market and cafe, which offer free food. "Seeing the difference you make in the community has been great, especially when you harvest the food and see people eat it," she said. Cobblestone Farms has used AmeriCorps volunteers in the past through grants written by the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences and Appleseeds Teaching Farm, Hayes said. This is the first year the farm has taken on the task of writing the grant, he said. While AmeriCorps didn't assign a dollar value to the grant, Hayes estimated corps members will be providing $80,000 worth of labor to the local hunger relief organizations. Cobblestone leases 25 acres off Wedington Drive from New Heights Church at no cost, Hayes said. The nonprofit uses sustainable and organic practices to raise everything from arugula to zucchini in its gardens, as well as sheep, pigs and broiler chickens, he said. The farm plans to produce 25,000 to 30,000 pounds of food this year to be donated to local hunger relief organizations such as the Northwest Arkansas Food Bank, he said. The organization also sells a small portion of its produce through a harvest share program, he said. Locally and sustainably grown food tends to be out of reach for a lot of families, Hayes said. The nonprofit aims to provide access to fresh, local, nutrient-dense food, he said. "We believe all community members have a right to have access to the best food they can get, and we feel we have the opportunity to grow that food, specifically for that purpose," he said. About 13% of households in Benton, Carroll, Madison and Washington counties were food insecure in 2019, according to Feeding America. The organization defines food insecurity as a lack of consistent access to enough food for every person in a household to live an active, healthy lifestyle. While Cobblestone has been around since 2011, it went through a rebranding and reorienting process about a year and a half ago and is now in what Hayes calls the 2.o phase of the program. He believes the land is producing at 40% of capacity and could raise 75,000 to 100,000 pounds of food a year. The farm has a slim staff, with four full-time employees and one part-time employee, Hayes said. Having the AmeriCorps members allows the staff to focus on building capacity and infrastructure for future seasons, he said. "If it wasn't for them being here to serve us in this way, we would just be keeping up," he said. ASSISTING ELSEWHERE Like Cobblestone Farms, Samaritan Community Center is expanding its garden operation, according to Megan Thomas, garden coordinator. The nonprofit has a garden on one-third of an acre in Rogers that grows organic vegetables, fruits and flowers for its market and cafes in Springdale and Rogers. The markets and cafes provide free food and meals to those in need, she said. The garden produces about 15,000 pounds of organic produce a year but is moving to a 1.5-acre location on the south side of Rogers, which will allow it to increase the amount of food it grows, expand its reach and provide more educational opportunities, she said. AmeriCorps members are helping Samaritan maintain its current garden so staff can focus on preparing the new site, Thomas said. "Partnering with other nonprofits is great because we all have similar missions, so it's really beneficial for us to work together," she said. Owen Ashley of Beaverton, Ore., joined AmeriCorps when he graduated from high school last year. He said he has enjoyed the volunteer experience and working outside. Assistant team leader Brian Freno of New Jersey graduated with a business degree last year and said he joined the corps to see the country and meet people. "It's been a really good experience," he said. "I've gained a lot of skills, a lot of life experience and made a lot of good friends." The corps members are keeping the food pantry at St. James Missionary Baptist Church in Fayetteville from being understaffed during the summer, according to Monique Jones, the church's director of outreach. The church has a food pantry that feeds about 450 families a week, Jones said. It has a drive-up pantry and delivers food in Springdale, Fayetteville, Farmington, Prairie Grove and Lincoln, she said. It also brings food boxes to all of Fayetteville's public housing projects. Summer is a great time to have extra help because many of the church's regular volunteers are on vacation, Jones said. Corps members have been helping with tasks such as checking in drive-through clients, data entry, food delivery and cleaning the yard, she said. AmeriCorps members have been helping the Northwest Arkansas Food Bank with its quarter-acre garden on its Springdale campus, according to Haley Deatherage, garden and nutrition manager. The teaching garden is designed to show people how to grow their own healthy organic produce and produce fresh food to distribute, she said. Corps members have been planting, trellising, harvesting, and doing pest control and general maintenance work, Deatherage said. They have planted about 100 plants and harvested more than 100 pounds of food so far, she said. The corps members are part of the Appleseeds Teaching Farm teams, helping with general garden chores as well as harvesting, packing and delivering food, said Cale Nicholson, manager of the nonprofit farm. "I couldn't do it alone, even with the amount of [community] volunteers we have, it's difficult to accomplish everything that needs to be done," he said.

         BELLA VISTA -- The Bella Vista Property Owners Association has always stocked its man-made lakes with various species of fish. When Rick Echols was hired as the POA's fish biologist in January 2016, he came from a fish hatchery and almost immediately put that experience to work. Since 2016, some of the fish caught in Bella Vista lakes were raised on ponds located on Bella Vista golf courses. One of the challenges of raising fish in a golf course pond is flooding, Echols said. He has used up to five ponds at a time on the Berksdale and Kingswood golf courses, but the ponds are often flooded by Little Sugar Creek. When the creek water invades the ponds it brings some large fish along with it. The fish from the creek head to the bottom of the ponds where they are less likely to be washed out. Once there the larger fish find the pond's fingerlings a convenient food source. Other fingerlings are washed out of the ponds by floodwater and end up in the creek where they probably suffer a similar fate. Next year, the fish-raising project will move to two brand new ponds below the Loch Lomond dam. The ponds will be built with a drain in place, Echols explained to the Lakes Committee during its June 8 meeting. A screen will be added to the drain pipe when it's time to drain the ponds and move the fish. Once most of the water is out, the fish will be removed with a net and transferred to a tank in a nearby truck, which will bring them to their new home. If all goes well in 2023, Echols plans to ask for the funds to build three more ponds. The area where the new ponds will go in could flood, Echols said. Water has gone over the dam in the past, but it doesn't happen often, and the ponds will be constructed by bringing in dirt and arranging it in berms rather than digging a hole. That will provide some protection, he said. Some of the tiny fish that Echols puts into the ponds are actually hatched in Bella Vista where a corner of the indoor fishing dock on Lake Avalon has been turned into a hatchery. "We've gotten really good at that part," he said. This year, the flooding happened just as he was ready to move newly hatched fish into the ponds. Once the ponds were flooded, the fish couldn't go in, and since it takes several weeks to drain and clean the ponds, and the newly hatched fry can't survive that long in the hatchery tanks, Echols and his staff were forced to put them directly into the lakes. He doesn't think many of them survived. His staff keeps track of the fish population, he explained. Some fish like channel catfish, are inexpensive, and it may be cheaper to buy the fingerlings than to hatch them. He can buy those fingerlings and let them grow in the nursery ponds. Other fish, like some of the hybrids, are expensive to buy as fingerlings but can be hatched and then moved to the ponds. "We just need to prioritize our need from year to year and use our five ponds to the best of our ability," he told the committee. When the new ponds are ready in the spring of next year, they will probably be used for saugeye and hybrid striped bass, he said. Over the six years that Echols has been raising fish, the project has only been successful twice, but that doesn't discourage him. After the hatchery equipment was put in place, raising fish is not expensive. The only cost now is the labor when the ponds are drained and the fish are moved around. With new dedicated nursery ponds most of that labor won't be necessary and the fish will have a safe place to grow, he said.  Print Headline: Tiny fish may move in 2023

         LITTLE ROCK -- Two men arrested last month after a Drug Enforcement Administration investigation culminated in the discovery of 222 pounds of methamphetamine in a storage facility in Little Rock were arraigned in federal court Thursday on drug conspiracy, possession and distribution charges. Michael Wayne Birdsong, 61, of Little Rock, and Aaron Bradley Williams, 40, of North Little Rock, were both arrested May 11 after investigators discovered the drugs in a storage unit at U-Haul Moving & Storage on Geyer Springs Road. Both men have been in custody at the Pulaski County jail since their arrest. A federal indictment handed up June 8 charged Birdsong with one count each of conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine, distribution of methamphetamine and possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine. Williams was charged with conspiracy and possession with intent. U.S. Magistrate Judge Jerome Kearney advised both men that on the conspiracy and possession counts, each faced a possible sentence of 10 years to life in prison and a $10 million fine. He told Birdsong that on the distribution count, he could face a possible sentence of 5 to 40 years in prison and a $5 million fine. He appointed Christophe Tarver with the Federal Public Defenders Office in Little Rock to represent Birdsong, and Jordan Tinsley of the Tinsley and Youngdahl law firm in Little Rock to represent Williams. Assistant U.S. Attorney Kristin Bryant is prosecuting the case, which is set for trial before Chief U.S. District Judge D. Price Marshall Jr. on June 25. According to the complaint, on May 2, a confidential source told investigators with the Drug Enforcement Administration Little Rock District Office Task Force Group that the source could purchase a half-pound of methamphetamine from Birdsong for $2,000 at Birdsong's Little Rock home. Two days later, the complaint said, the controlled buy was made, during which time Williams' car was seen at Birdsong's home. In the ensuing investigation, the complaint said, officers monitored Birdsong's movements over the next several days and tailed Birdsong and Williams from Birdsong's home to a U-Haul Moving & Storage facility on Geyer Springs Road, where they saw the two men come out of the storage facility with a black roller duffle bag that they placed in Williams' car. On May 11, the complaint said, after investigators reviewed security video and activity logs at the storage facility, a drug dog was brought to the site. The complaint said the dog alerted on the unit rented by Birdsong, so the Little Rock Police Department executed a search warrant at the storage unit and seized approximately 222 pounds of methamphetamine and approximately five pounds of marijuana.

         BELLA VISTA -- A temporary public art installation has bloomed in Bella Vista. The Bella Vista in Bloom exhibit is a creative fiber works installation, to which more than 25 Bella Vista artists have contributed by making yarn flowers, bees, butterflies, large letters and more that adorn areas around the city. The installation will be in place through July 11. Bella Vista Mayor Peter Christie kicked off the exhibit June 11 by reading a proclamation in celebration of National Yarn Bombing Day during an event at the Bella Vista Public Library, which was followed by a volunteer appreciation party. Yarn bombing is a form of street art, in which artists cover or decorate public objects with knitted or crocheted yarn. This art is in place on the Marilyn Monroe statue in front of City Hall and on the fence around the city's police and fire departments at Town Center, in addition to areas at the library and Bella Vista Historical Museum. The Bella Vista Arts Council, a city advisory board, is sponsoring the temporary art installation, which it hopes will bring visibility to Bella Vista arts by attracting visitors and creating art tourism. Bella Vista has over 100 career artists actively working and creating for art exhibitions, public art, workshops and education. This program, which took two months to create the various yarn items, is offered as a community engagement event in support of the city's public art initiative, to be held each year. The idea came about as part of the Arts Council board's three-year public art strategy and is a way for the Arts Council to engage more resident artists for a larger impact throughout the city. It supports the city initiatives to provide citizens and visitors with a way to engage with the artworks of the creative community. Mercy Clinic provided its community room for the assembly process of over 50 flowers of various sizes, stems, leaves, butterflies, bees and 40-inch letters. Arts Council member Debra DeVilbiss led the initiative and brought her own needle-working talents to the program. Bella Vista Public Library staff coordinated with the We're Hooked! knitting and crocheting club volunteers, and Bella Vista Historical Museum's Jill Werner created the unique design and layout for the museum installation. More than 25 different volunteers participated with 15 needleworks creating the individual components. Some provided crocheted items; some provided knitted items. Others were beginners who volunteered to learn basic skills in order to contribute to the project. Other volunteers who focused on assembling and installing the fiber-works.

        BENTONVILLE -- The sun is setting Wednesday evening at Phillips Park, as youth baseball coaches throw the last few pitches to their players. The teams huddle up and hear a few parting words. The lights begin to warm. The children mosey, jog or race off the field. A new group patiently awaits their turn in the parking lot, baseballs and bats in hand. They chat convivially. Some speak English. The scene is a common one at the park during the youth baseball season, according to Sreeni Parise, co-founder of NWA Cricket. Cricket teams have the fields reserved for a few tournaments each year. During baseball season, they wait their turn, he said. "When there isn't baseball, there's someone playing cricket." THE LEAGUE Most of the teams in NWA Cricket play every weekday after office hours, according to Mahesh Natarajan, one of four core team members who are heavily involved in organizing the regional league. When Parise helped start the organization in 2010, four or five teams were involved. Now, about 30 teams, totaling around 500 people, play regularly at parks across the region, he said. Each team plays at least once or twice during the week and once or twice over the weekend, he said. The season begins each April with practice matches, which are followed by a tournament during July and August called the NWA Cricket Championship. The championship will begin the first week of July, Parise said. Another tournament ends the season in September and October, he said. Most of the league's growth, and the sports' popularity at Northwest Arkansas' public parks, is from Indians moving into the area for work, especially because of Walmart, he said. Both Parise and Natarajan grew up playing cricket in India. There, the league's format of teams and tournaments would be similar, but with many more teams, Parise said. Field hockey is the official national sport of India, but cricket is a significant part of Indian culture, like Bollywood movies, he said. It is also an international sport: Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Australia, South Africa and the United Kingdom are all represented among local teams, he said. Parise said playing teams in other towns and states has shown the diversity of the countries that enjoy the game. The sport is played in at least 104 countries, according to the governing body, the International Cricket Council. Across the United States, over 200,000 players and 400 local leagues compete in various formats, according to the organization USA Cricket. THE GAME In cricket, a "bowler" throws a hard leather ball to a player on the opposing team called the batsman or batter. The bowler and batter stand opposite each other in the center of the playing field known as the "pitch." The pitch consists of two "wickets" about 20 yards apart, sets of three upright sticks topped with horizontal pieces called "bails." A batter stands at each end while the bowler throws to the opposite batter. Ten players on the bowling team stand scattered around ready to field the ball. While the batter tries to defend the wicket and score runs by hitting the ball, the bowler attempts to hit the wicket and knock over the stumps or bails. If the bowler knocks off the bails, the batter is out. When a batter hits the ball, both batters can choose to run back and forth between the wickets, scoring a run each time both reach the opposite side. If a batter hits a ball in the air over the outside boundary line, the team scores six runs. If the ball bounces across the boundary line, the team scores four. Each bowler throws six balls at the wicket before completing an "over," which brings a different bowler onto the field. Cricket matches can vary in length, but a common length for NWA Cricket matches is 16 overs per side, totaling about three hours, Parise said. Batters can also get out when a fielder catches their ball before it touches the ground, the batter uses their legs to block the ball from hitting the wickets or a fielder knocks down the wicket with the ball while the batter is running between wickets. The two teams take turns batting and bowling, one or two "innings" each, in an attempt to score the most runs. A distinct feature of cricket is that it is customizable, Natarajan said. Teams can play in almost any location for as short as an hour or as long as five days. Sometimes, the equipment used can vary. NWA Cricket teams use a certain extra soft baseball when playing on the dirt of local baseball diamonds. Teams have found the baseball bounces similar on dirt to regulation cricket balls, which are harder and more likely to injure players, according to Parise. Though a regulation field is a circle with a diameter of about 150 yards, the flexibility of the sport has helped Parise and others continue playing in the U.S. amid a lack of official facilities. "In India, we used to play in the streets," he said. "When we came in 1998, playing on a baseball field was the weirdest thing, but it became a part of our life. We played on basketball courts, tennis courts, anywhere." THE PARKS Cricket teams compete regularly at public fields and parks in Rogers and Bentonville. Northwest Arkansas does not have any regulation cricket facilities, but that will change soon, according to city officials. Teams often play during the weekends at a field just south of Rogers High School, according to Jim White, director of Rogers parks and recreation. The field hosted a four-day cricket tournament in cooperation with Cricket Council USA over Memorial Day weekend, he said. The Parks Department added a concrete cricket pitch to the field years ago, but there are no lights or bleachers, so cricket teams leave when the sun sets, according to White. The field is also used by the school for activities like cross country, so cricket teams have to cooperate with the school and the Parks Department to use the property, he said. White said the teams occasionally rent city-owned fields. "We don't have true cricket fields within our parks system," he said. "Sometimes our baseball fields are not the best for them, but they use them all the time." Parks department officials in Springdale and Fayetteville said the cities don't have cricket facilities, because they have not seen significant demand for it in recent years, as Bentonville has. Bentonville plans to build a full-fledged playing field as a part of the planned Creekside Park, Parise said. In addition to a playground, splash park, recreational areas and trails, the 35-acre park on Southwest 28th Street will house a regulation, fully lighted cricket field when it opens sometime around next spring. A 20-year dream of having ideal cricket facilities is finally coming to fruition after talking to city staff for years, Parise said. "Without the parks' help and cooperation, we could not play in Bentonville," he said. "This park is important for a lot of reasons, but cricket is the big reason," said Josh Stacey, recreation services director for Bentonville. "As the years have gone on, it's become more and more popular. As we were doing the Bentonville master plan, it was obvious that this was a sport that needed its own facilities." To his knowledge, it will be the first cricket facility in Arkansas, he said. Lights over the field, raised areas for seating and park benches will all be part of the project, according to Stacey. He said the new field will only begin to meet the needs of the area's cricket culture. "There's still going to be a big presence at Phillips Park," he said. Parise said he would be interested in seeing "the locals" pick up cricket. Though there are definite differences, parts of cricket are similar to baseball, making the game accessible for Americans who would be interested in learning, he said. With local programs and the International Cricket Council's 2024 World Cup set to take place in the United States, there is the potential for cricket's popularity to grow, according to Parise. "When we have the tournaments, we see that curiosity and interest from people who stop to watch," he said. "We expect that to go up over time."

         FORT SMITH -- City directors are considering building a $31.2 million indoor sports facility in Fort Smith, which is expected to have a $42.4 million annual economic output due to direct and indirect spending, according to Conventions Sports and Leisure International. The directors heard a feasibility study presentation by Conventions Sports and Leisure International on Tuesday evening, which discussed market demand, comparable facilities in similar cities, industry trends and business models. The study cost $30,000, which was paid by a $15,000 matching grant from Arkansas Tourism, $7,500 from the city's Advertising and Promotions Commission and Convention and Visitors Bureau, and $7,500 from the city. CSL's presentation states an indoor sports facility would address city opportunities and needs related to sports tourism or tournaments on the weekends, while also enhancing opportunities for local sports and recreation users during the week. They measured interest through interviews with stakeholders and potential user groups, and found demand for an indoor sports facility to be moderately strong to strong. "Market research and analysis suggest that a state of the industry Indoor Sports Facility, suitable to accommodate basketball, volleyball, wrestling, pickleball, dance, cheer, martial arts, indoor soccer and off-season/supplemental training for various field sports and their related tournaments, games, practices and training activities, could address certain local and non-local market demand that is not currently being met by existing facilities in the local and regional marketplace," the presentation packet states. "In particular, volleyball, basketball, wrestling and soccer appear to be some of the most prominent sports that would represent core uses of a new Indoor Sports Facility in Fort Smith." CSL's studies found an indoor sports facility could serve over 225,000 individuals within a 30-minute drive, and 5.9 million people within a three-hour drive; and unlike outdoor sports facilities such as baseball or soccer complexes, an indoor facility could be used year-round and accommodate a number of sports. CSL's recommendation is to build a 120,000-square-foot facility with eight full-sized basketball courts or 16 full-sized volleyball courts, and synthetic turf for one regulation-sized field. They also suggested a minimum 35-foot ceiling so nets could drop down to separate court and turf spaces or also be used for batting cages, locker rooms and team rooms, fitness and wellness spaces, a walking track, play areas, a food court, performance and esports spaces and 900 parking spaces -- all on a site of at least 10 acres. "Other types of projects can in certain cases be married with these types of projects," CSL Principal Bill Krueger said. "Often times they're phased in the sense of you either build the indoor facility first, but then you co-locate it with a high quality field complex of some sort, where you've got multiple fields that are tournament quality lined up. So you have a sports destination that many communities are investing lots of money into in exchange for the community good for the local residents, but importantly also for the economic impact." Krueger said the facility would be different from holding tournaments in the Fort Smith Convention Center because the center has high costs to set up and tear down equipment, which takes time away from hosting conventions, conferences or trade shows. He said similar indoor sports facilities are the TBK Bank Sportsplex in Bettendorf, Iowa; Cape Girardeau Sportsplex in Cape Girardeau, Mo.; and the Fieldhouse USA Frisco in Frisco, Texas, which can generate $200,000 to $500,000 in profit each year, depending on the market and what sports are being used. Krueger said CSL didn't do a specific site analysis, but suggested locations for the facility are near the soccer complex and the U.S. Marshal's Museum along the Arkansas River, Ben Geren Regional Park and Chaffee Crossing. He said if the city wants to move forward with the project, next steps would be exploring site options and funding sources. Ward 3 Director Lavon Morton asked how the comparable cities paid for their indoor sports facilities. Krueger said they paid through either a general obligation bond backed by credit or property taxes; revenue bonds through hospitality, visitor industry, hotel, sales, entertainment or food and beverage taxes; or the city's annual capital budget. "We don't really see the private operator coming in with money, cash in hand, to help with the capital stack up front," he said. At-large Director Kevin Settle suggested city administrators talk to the comparable cities and see how they funded it. He also suggested the city meet with the Boys & Girls' Club, Fort Smith School District, the University of Arkansas-Fort Smith and local sports leagues to see if they're interested in using and helping pay for the facility. Morton said he thinks that could help in generating revenue, but he's concerned about construction costs and asking residents for a tax increase after they just renewed a 1% city sales tax last month. Krueger said the city could also issue a request for proposal for acquisition of land or facility management, to see if there is any private sector interest in the project. "Sports Facilities Companies, for example, they often get involved after our feasibility study," he said. "If you're going down the road, they can help you with certain financing, setting up a more detailed look at the programming and the construction costs and items like that, as it leads into having a project that you can break ground with. So those are just some of the aspects that we tend to see in terms of next steps. And we'd be happy to share our two cents along the way, if ultimately you're interested in speaking more about next steps." Tim Jacobsen, executive director of the Advertising and Promotions Commission, said there's a "huge void" in this part of the country for this type of facility. "So if Fort Smith doesn't do it, somebody else is going to do it," he said. "Little Rock has gone to the ballot a number of times to try to look at facilities, whether it be indoor or outdoor or both. So I think it's our job from the Convention District Bureau and the A&P to continue to look at different opportunities of economic development that can bring tourism and help our existing businesses that are here."

         FORT SMITH -- City Directors are considering temporarily halting residential building surrounding the Fort Smith Regional Airport to conduct a sound study and potentially modify area building codes in preparation for the Foreign Military Sales program. The program is expected to house aircraft louder than those the airport currently has. Ebbing Air National Guard Base -- which is at the airport -- was selected last year as the Air Force's preferred location for a pilot training center for Singapore and other countries participating in the Foreign Military Sales program. The proposal would accommodate up to 24 Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II aircraft and move 12 General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcons from the Singapore air force, currently at Luke Air Force Base at Glendale, Ariz. City Administrator Carl Geffken explained at the directors' study session on Tuesdaythe sound study would keep the city from expanding building codes unnecessarily. "So in order to make sure that we don't waste builders' time by trying to put in triple paned glass or putting in extra sound insulation that's not needed," he said. Geffken said the moratorium wouldn't impact residents building up to a 25% addition to their home. He said the city would use the study as part of its environmental impact statement for the Foreign Military Sales program. The Foreign Military program could pick the Selfridge Air National Guard Base in Harrison Township, Mich., if the city allowed building that had a negative impact. City Attorney Jerry Canfield said the moratorium would expire no later than Dec. 31, 2023, and could expire earlier if regulation information is received and the city modifies the building codes. "It does not apply to the residential uses in areas other than the moratorium area," he clarified. "It does not apply even in the moratorium area to accessory residential uses, or to commercial or industrial uses. The ordinance especially recognizes that the Planning Commission and Planning Department, together with developers, may continue to work on developments but any developments and any approvals must be conditioned on the possible regulations, and on the requirement of those building permits being issued during the moratorium period." Ward 4 Director George Catsavis asked if the city is trying to purchase properties that would be impacted by the moratorium. Geffken said it was considered, but it would deplete the city's treasury, and the temporary moratorium is a more prudent solution. He said less than 10 projects are far enough along in the process that they will still be able to get built during the moratorium, adding he doesn't think it will impact Fort Smith from being selected for the Foreign Military Sales program. At-large Director Neal Martin asked if the sound study results will affect homes in the area in any way. Canfield said it depends on what code regulations the city develops. Two individuals spoke about being impacted by the moratorium during the study session. John Alford, a legal representative for Massard Commercial Park Development, said Massard was planning to develop duplexes on 20 acres of the land, which was expected to bring $25 million-$30 million worth of residential housing to Fort Smith. He said Massard will lose money if unable to go forward with the development. "Building costs -- I know for raw materials -- has just skyrocketed in the last couple of years," At-large Director Robyn Dawson said. "However, in residential building, if your client is permitted to build after the moratorium and it is at a higher price -- which most likely it will be -- would he not just pass that higher price onto the customer of the home? So it didn't impact your client directly, it would actually be passed on to the buyer." "We're talking about rents and affordability," Alford said. "There is competition throughout the city. There's a project I think you all may have approved not too long ago that is going to be building a multiphase of different types of housing. So if they're allowed to start their project now and we have to wait a year -- it's all about the lease of rents and affordability." Dawson asked what Alford's suggestions are that wouldn't impact the military sales program. He suggested trading property with the city or compensation that would allow Massard to build warehouses on that land instead. Kyle Parker, president and CEO of the Arkansas Colleges of Health Education, said the school's plan is to building 146 apartments for students in some of the moratorium area. He asked whether the city could contact other city planning departments that have F-35s and see what building codes they have and implement those without doing their own sound study. Ward 2 Director Andre Good reiterated he's concerned any residential development might cause Fort Smith not to be chosen for the program. "I would just encourage the city to actively and quickly work in that direction to try to do something that would accommodate," Ward 3 Director Lavon Morton said. "I think that's fair." "Right now, we need to know the data and the facts in order to make an informed decision before I ask the board to spend millions of dollars, potentially," Geffken said. "Because that's relocation, be it residential, commercial or industrial." The moratorium is on the directors' agenda for consideration at their next regular board meeting on Tuesday.

         BELLA VISTA -- The Bella Vista Planning Commission took a variety of actions during its regular session Monday evening. The first two items listed on the agenda were approved and sent on to the City Council after discussion by the commissioners. One was an amendment to the zoning code to define short-term rentals and include them within the city's use chart. According to the wordage of the amendment, the move will "provide for inclusion of short-term rental uses within the table of uses, to determine a short-term rental usage as of right or with a conditional use permit within particular zones, and for other purposes." The short-term rental definition was amended to the following: "Short-term rental means a residential dwelling unit, portion of a dwelling unit, or bedroom within a dwelling unit, leased or rented to guests for a period of less than thirty (30) consecutive days." The second item being submitted to the City Council is a request to rezone a parcel near Kingsdale Lane from conservation zoning to neighborhood commercial. The parcel is currently a parking lot located east of Riordan Hall and the Kingsdale Pool. The request was submitted by the Bella Vista Property Owners Association, as part of the process it is currently going through as it prepares for the construction of a new member services building. "We are requesting this change to be in line with the current uses, but also we anticipate building a member services building on this property which will be in line with all the other entities that are already there, to serve our members and our residents better," said POA Director of Recreation and Wellness Joan Glubczynski. A zoning variance request was also approved during the session on the side setback to build additions onto an existing house at 15 Marykirk Lane. The applicant, Michael Saltz, requested the variance to construct a proposed house addition into both the north and south side setbacks, in the amounts of 6½ feet and 6 feet, respectively, in lieu of the requested 10 feet. The Planning Commission also approved a zoning variance request for a temporary sign at 100 Cooper Road. The variance was requested by the Bella Vista United Lutheran Church, which wants to post changeable banners promoting fundraising, services and other church events throughout the year. The applicant also requested keeping the supporting T-posts that hold up the banners in the ground at that location year-round, and to be able to display the applicable banners 10 days prior to an event, running until the last day of the event. Staff recommended approving the request with the provision the church obtain a temporary sign permit annually -- which is standard code requirement -- for periods of planned recurring use and that the application be in sync with this request. A zoning variance request was approved for applicant Archie Birkner, who was requesting a variance on the platted rear setback for a proposed deck at 3 Carroll Drive. Birkner said he intends to reduce the 20-foot platted setback by 5 feet to establish a 15-foot rear setback. Two related items were tabled by the Planning Commission until its July 11 regular session. One was a request to waive the street frontage requirements for new lots in the subdivision jurisdiction for lot split 43663 and the other was the actual lot split itself regarding land near 12905 Miller Church Road. Both were requested by Ramsey Surveying.  Print Headline: Bella Vista planners look at short-term rentals

         FORT SMITH -- People in the River Valley and beyond can now secure their seats for an upcoming showcase of films from around the world. Tickets for the second Fort Smith International Film Festival went on sale Tuesday . The festival will be held downtown Aug. 26-27 at TempleLive. Brandon Goldsmith, president of the River Valley Film Society and executive director of the film festival, said he loves films and wants everyone else to do the same with him. To him, the festival is a way to help both facilitate that and grow the creative economy in River Valley. Goldsmith argued a distinguishing factor about film is it incorporates a wide range of other art forms, such as music, acting, writing, painting and design. Encouraging people to do this through the film festival will encourage the creative economy in the area to grow, which will grow the creatives there. Goldsmith believes this will allow the culture to truly come alive due to it allowing people to tell their stories. Tim Jacobsen, executive director of the Fort Smith Convention and Visitors Bureau, said he believes the event helps cultivate the city's brand to be more inclusive of arts and entertainment. This is important in selling an overall destination to people from outside the area. He also expects to see "nothing but increases" from the festival every year in terms of attendance and economic impact to the city given its prior success. "They do a very good job on putting it together and executing the event," Jacobsen said. Goldsmith said more than 400 people attended the first festival last year. He hopes that figure will at least double for this year's event barring any further surges of the covid-19 pandemic. Tickets and Submissions Advance general admission tickets for the festival are available through the event's website, FortSmithFilm.com, for $10, according to Goldsmith. This does not include a $2.50 TempleLive facility fee and a processing fee. A limited quantity of VIP tickets is also available for $30 each on top of the other fees. Goldsmith said these will afford moviegoers their first choice of seating to watch the films that will be shown during the event, as well as access to the filmmakers and actors, among other things. TempleLive has four rooms in which films will be screened. People can also pay $15 for general admission on the days of the festival. Clay Pruitt, programming director for the festival, said Tuesday the festival had a team of more than 30 volunteers screen the films submitted for the event between Feb. 4 through June 3. This has been very helpful in facilitating an overall better selection of films for this year compared to last year, the screening process for which only involved a handful of people from the River Valley Film Society. "The goal is to not only have more films, but have better films this year for the community to watch," Pruitt said. Goldsmith said the submissions during this time totalled 364 films from 51 countries, in addition to entries from the Choctaw and Cherokee nations. This all includes short and feature-length films, people of color and indigenous films, music videos, animation shorts, high school and college student shorts and documentary shorts and features. Pruitt noted there were significantly more feature-length submissions this time around than last year, resulting in more hours of content. The film screening process began in March and was set to conclude by Saturday. Goldsmith said the next step is for the festival to determine which films are going to be shown during the event, which entails creating the entire schedule for it. "We may find ourselves at some point going through all the films and going, 'I need a five to seven minute comedy to fit in this slot right here, what is the best comedy that we have that'll fit in this slot,'" Goldsmith said. "What we do is we do blocks of time, so we may do an hour-block of comedy, and our films are all the way from two minutes long to two hours long." Goldsmith said the films that will be shown will be eligible for cash prizes, trophies and scholarships from the University of Arkansas-Fort Smith. The organizers have until the beginning of July to notify filmmakers their work has been selected. A news release Goldsmith provided states the final line-up of films will be announced in August. The theme for this year's film festival is "Borderlands." The news release defines borderlands as the place where the stories of peoples' lives exist and references Fort Smith's history as a border town. "Our shared humanity is experienced at the borders between countries, nations, states, cities, neighborhoods, languages, races, genders, cultures, social economic classes and ages," the release states. "Borderlands are where innovation happens, realities are challenged, novel concepts and fresh identities are born and questioned. Film acts as a threshold between actuality and fantasy capturing the moment a border is established, defended or overcome." Tickets going on sale for the event comes right before another, similar event in this part of the state: the Bentonville Film Festival. This festival will begin its eighth outing Wednesday with in-person events being held through June 26 and virtual events through July 3, according to its website. The theme for the festival is "Championing women and diverse voices." Fayetteville Film Fest is also slated to take place Oct. 20-22 as well, according to that event's website.
