        The severe thunderstorms forecasted for Friday have passed through Arkansas, according to the National Weather Service in North Little Rock. There is still light rain predicted for the southeastern part of the state, said Sean Clarke, a weather service meteorologist. The state largely received between 1 to 3 inches of rain. However, Booneville had received the most rain, with averages of over 3 inches, Clarke said just before noon. There have been reports of damage to roads and fallen trees due to flooding in Clark and Sebastian counties, according to Clark. He said the flooding was what the weather service expected to see given the conditions, though. 10:58 a.m.: Severe weather to bring chance for large hail, strong winds to parts of Arkansas, forecasters say Strong to severe storms are expected across the state Friday, according to the National Weather Service in North Little Rock. The thunderstorms are forecasted to be able to produce large hail, about a quarter in size, and strong gusts of wind up to 80 mph, a briefing from the weather service states. The potential for tornadoes is low.  Joe Goudsward, a meteorologist at the weather service in North Little Rock, said the chance for severe weather in northern and Central Arkansas had already decreased significantly by 8:20 a.m. According to Goudsward, the southern part of the state near the Louisiana border is most at risk for severe storms. While the greatest risk for severe weather in northern and Central Arkansas has passed, the rainfall is not expected to be out of the state until 1 p.m.  A flood watch was issued by the weather service Friday morning for much of Arkansas, starting in the northwest part of the state and moving southeast, crossing over Little Rock. The watch is in effect through 2 p.m. Friday.  There is an increased risk of flash flooding due to recent rainfall and saturated soil, according to the weather service. Several small tributaries remain swollen, such as Fourche LaFave, Petit Jean and Saline rivers. The river levels are expected to remain elevated.  Flooding may impact road conditions, Goudsward said Thursday. Several sections of highways in Sebastian County, including parts of U.S. 64 and Arkansas 96, have closed due to flooding and high water, according to the state Department of Transportation. The agency reported portions of at least 4 roads had closed due to high water in less than an hour. High temperatures are still forecast for next week. Arkansas is expected to have hot and humid temperatures next week with heat index values possibly exceeding 105 degrees. Goudsward said Arkansans should stay in the shade when possible, wear light colors and drink lots of water.  For a full list of weather warnings, visit the National Weather Service in North Little Rock at weather.gov/lzk/.

        Both westbound lanes of Interstate 30 northeast of Caddo Valley were reopened by Thursday evening after a pileup involving a dozen or more vehicles killed three people Wednesday and closed the road for more than 24 hours, authorities said. Damage caused to the road near mile marker 86 by the crash and the ensuing fire required Arkansas Department of Transportation workers to tear up about 350 feet of damaged road surface, lay new pavement in both lanes and then smooth that asphalt before one lane was reopened around 1:30 p.m. Thursday, agency spokesman Dave Parker said. The second lane was opened by 6:20, according to a tweet from the agency. The fire had at least partially melted the pavement, Parker said. Parker couldn't say how long that sort of work might take under normal circumstances, but said that they made the repair a priority because of the importance of I-30. "We needed to get that road open," Parker said. Parker said he couldn't recall a crash this large or tragic in his years living in the state, and that he couldn't remember ever closing a highway for so long other than during inclement weather. Arkansas State Police on Thursday identified one of the three people killed as George Thomas Adamson III, 65, of Hope, according to a preliminary fatality report. Adamson was westbound on I-30 when he attempted to avoid another crash. His vehicle left the north side of the highway around the 85-mile marker and struck a tree, according to the report. The body of another person was sent to the Arkansas Crime Laboratory for identification, state police spokesman Bill Sadler said, while investigators were still following up on leads to identify the third deceased motorist.   One person injured in the wreck was in critical condition Thursday, Sadler added, and investigators were still trying to verify the statuses of 10 people who were transported from the scene after the pileup. "We anticipate a number of those 10 will by now have been released [from hospitals]," Sadler said. Traffic camera footage on ARDOT's iDrive Arkansas site showed westbound traffic moving normally by Thursday evening. Other ARDOT crews were at the scene Thursday afternoon assisting those in need, and most motorists not driving 18-wheelers were able to get off I-30, Parker said. Shannon Newton, the president of the Arkansas Trucking Association, said in an email that truck drivers may have chosen to sleep in their vehicles instead of driving around the accident once the scene was safe in order to comply with federal regulations. According to her, professional drivers have to follow hours-of-service regulations that ensure they are well-rested before driving. Slow traffic could cause that time to run out, which Newton said could give drivers the options of parking where they are or operating illegally until they find safe parking. "Unexpected congestion like the hours-long backup on I-30 this week affects all drivers, but while I may run out of gas or miss my meetings, truck drivers are legally required to stop operating after 14 hours on the clock to comply with federal rules," said Newton. The pileup started as a two-vehicle crash about 30 miles south of Hot Springs, which the Transportation Department said was a minor wreck. Parker said it may have been weather-related, as rain had begun and lowered visibility. The crash led to a chain reaction of at least a dozen vehicles colliding, including multiple 18-wheelers. Karla Denton, a Bryant resident, recorded video of the wreck Wednesday around 12:30 p.m. as she was heading home from visiting family. "I could see smoke in the air ahead but thought it was possibly a brush fire. Traffic was moving normally, but the roads were wet. Within a minute I could see what was clearly a horrible wreck with the trucks in front of the pile-up on fire. Traffic started to slow down as the fire grew larger," said Denton in a Facebook message. According to her, she was able to feel the heat from the fire on the other side of the interstate and she heard explosions as she drove by. "I saw how many vehicles were involved, the first responders and others who were trying to help, and it just broke my heart. I actually got emotional and got off at the next exit," Denton said. "I knew there would be casualties in what I saw. I posted the video on Facebook to let people be aware and to avoid that direction so first responders could get there faster and safer." She said her father used to be a truck driver and she knew that this was a nightmare for the families of the drivers involved.      Gallery: I-30 Backups After Major Wreck  Print Headline: I-30 reopens at site of crash where 3 killed

         An Alexander doctor on trial for multiple counts of fraud, conspiracy, identity theft and lying to the FBI was found guilty of all 22 counts by a jury of seven men and five women in federal court Thursday. Dr. Joe David May, also known as "Jay May," faced 22 federal counts including one count each of conspiracy to generate kickbacks and generate fraudulent prescriptions, solicitation and receipt of kickbacks and bribes, falsifying records to impede an investigation, false statements, two counts of identify theft, four counts of fraud and 10 counts of aiding and abetting wire fraud. The jury deliberated for three hours after four full days of testimony and a day of closing arguments and instructions. Over the course of the trial, they heard from co-defendants, Tricare beneficiaries and investigators as assistant U.S. attorneys Alex Morgan and Stephanie Mazzanti attempted to provide a picture of May's involvement in the fraud and subsequent cover-up attempt and as defense attorney Shelly Koehler of Fayetteville attempted to poke holes in that picture. At about 6:25 p.m. court officials were notified the jury had reached a verdict and within a few minutes, May and Koehler, along with about a dozen of May's family members who have been present throughout the trial, walked quietly into the courtroom, quickly followed by Morgan and Mazzanti. At 6:35, U.S. District Judge Kristine G. Baker walked in and called the court to order. Before calling the jury in, Baker admonished the courtroom to remain orderly while the verdicts were read. "It's going to take a while to read these verdicts so everyone please keep their composure and I don't want any outbursts, please," Baker said. "Let's all hold it together while I make it through all of the verdicts, please." As Baker read the first verdict, guilty on Count 1 -- conspiracy to commit wire fraud -- May's wife began to sob quietly in the gallery as May, seated at the defense table, looked alternately at his hands folded in his lap and the far wall of the courtroom, his face expressionless during the eight minutes it took Baker to read verdicts on all 22 counts. After that, at Koehler's request, Baker polled each juror on each count, asking if they had voted guilty, which took another 25 minutes. In Koehler's summation for the defense, she said the government's case amounted to trying to pound a round peg into a square hole, "and no matter how hard they try to shove and shove and shove, it just doesn't fit." Koehler hit hard on the lack of a recording of May's January 2016 FBI interview. FBI Special Agent Jill Hudson, when testifying on Wednesday, said she and another agent, Justin Beach, interviewed May while Beach took notes of the interview. "I asked Agent Hudson was the interview recorded," Koehler said. "I said 'why not' and she said 'I don't know, it's policy.'" The lack of recordings from May's interview, Koehler said, made it impossible to determine for sure what May had or had not said to the FBI. "Here we are, seven years later," she said, "arguing about what he said or what he didn't say." Koehler pulled up a number of prescription forms that she said had what looked like May's signature but which she said were actually forged without May's knowledge. "Fraud has absolutely been committed," she said, "but not by my client. Not even remotely close to by my client." In his closing, Morgan walked jurors through each of the charges against May, the different elements of each charge, and a timeline of the events that culminated in charges against a total of 10 people, including May, on federal counts of fraud and conspiracy. Morgan told jurors that May signed prescriptions at the behest of his longtime friend, Derek Clifton, a former Baxter County basketball coach-turned-medical sales rep, and that the fraud went on as long as it did because Tricare didn't -- as a matter of course -- question prescriptions until and unless it was alerted that something was wrong. "Tricare is not in the business of catching fraud," Morgan said. "Tricare is in the business of delivering health care to our nation's veterans. They trust the professionals to do the right thing." In the case of May, Morgan said, that trust was betrayed. He said Clifton, along with Glenn Hudson -- who also testified at the trial -- developed a streamlined process for finding Tricare beneficiaries, signing them up for high-cost drugs from a Mississippi compounding pharmacy, sending pre-filled prescription forms needing only a provider's signature to willing doctors who would then sign off on the prescriptions without ever having seen or talked to the patients receiving the prescriptions. May was originally charged in January 2020 along with Clifton in a 41-page indictment. A superseding indictment the following September added Kenneth Myers Jr. of Alpharetta, Ga., to the indictment. Clifton, who pleaded guilty in November 2020 to one count of conspiracy to violate the federal anti-kickback statute, testified earlier this week against May, implicating him in the issuance of over 200 prescriptions written to more than a hundred Tricare beneficiaries over a one-year period in 2015. Clifton was sentenced to 51 months in prison in May 2021. Myers pleaded guilty to conspiracy to violate the federal anti-kickback statute in August and is awaiting sentencing. He faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison. Myers did not testify at May's trial. Other co-conspirators -- charged in separate indictments -- are Donna Crowder of North Little Rock, Jennifer Crowder (formerly Bracy) of Little Rock, Keith Benson of North Little Rock, Keith Hunter of Little Rock, Angie Johnson of North Little Rock, and Blake Yoder of Scott. All have pleaded guilty to conspiracy to violate the federal anti-kickback statute. May will be sentenced after completion of a pre-sentence report by the U.S. Probation Office, which will determine the federal sentencing guideline ranges for each of the counts May was found guilty on. Statutory maximum penalties are five years in prison on the conspiracy count, the anti-kickback statute count, falsifying and altering records counts, and lying to the FBI. For the wire and mail fraud counts, the maximum sentence is 20 years in prison. At the conclusion of the hearing, Baker allowed May to remain free on pre-trial conditions until his sentencing date. Once court was adjourned, May walked to the gallery and embraced his wife as other family members crowded around them, many in tears.

        Arkansas' count of coronavirus cases rose Thursday by 663, a smaller increase than the ones on the previous two days but still larger than the daily rise a week earlier. After rising by double-digits the previous three days, the number of people hospitalized in the state with covid-19 fell by one, to 145. The state's death toll from the virus, as tracked by the Arkansas Department of Health, rose by one, to 11,512. The increase in cases, which followed spikes of 805 on Tuesday and 887 on Wednesday, was larger by 28 than the rise the previous Thursday. State Epidemiologist Mike Cima said the smaller increase Thursday compared with the previous two days was likely a "one-day aberration." "In the grand scheme of things, I think the trend is continuing in that upward direction," he said. One indication is the percentage of coronavirus tests that are positive. Over the seven days ending Wednesday, he said, it was 12%, the highest weekly percentage so far since the state's new cases began trending upward in April. Gov. Asa Hutchinson has said he wants the percentage below 10%. Cima said the upward trend will likely continue at least through next week, although he noted that new cases have been declining in some states that experienced upticks before Arkansas. "I think it's safe to expect that the trend will reach its peak sometime soon, all things held equal," Cima said of Arkansas' increasing new case numbers. He said getting vaccinated is one of the most important things people can do to protect themselves from the virus. Whether people take other precautions, such as wearing masks in public places, is an "individual choice," he said. "I personally don't like being sick," Cima said. "I don't know anybody who does like being sick, so I, in my own personal life, am doing everything possible to prevent illness from myself, certainly my young daughter and of course my wife, too." Already at its highest level since the week ending March 24, the average daily rise in Arkansas' case count over a rolling seven-day period grew Thursday to 573. At its highest level since Feb. 27, the number of cases in the state that were considered active rose by 322, to 5,883, as new cases outpaced recoveries. After rising the previous two days, the number of the state's virus patients who were on ventilators fell by one, to four. The number who were in intensive care, which rose by four a day earlier, fell Thursday by two, to 17. At its hospitals in Little Rock and Springdale, Arkansas Children's had three covid-19 patients on Thursday, up from two a day earlier, spokeswoman Hilary DeMillo said. MAP UPDATED Reflecting the state's upward trend in cases and hospitalizations, the "covid-19 community level" in seven Arkansas counties rose from "low" to "medium" under the latest update to a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention map. During the week ending Wednesday, Pulaski, Crittenden, Sharp and Woodruff counties each had at least 200 new cases per 100,000 residents, the cutoff that causes a county's level to be at least medium. Sharp County had the highest rate, with about 310 new cases per 100,000 residents, followed by Woodruff County with 237 per 100,000, Pulaski County with 209 per 100,000 and Crittenden County with 202 per 100,000. The new case rates weren't that high in Baxter, Phillips and Marion counties, but their covid-19 level rose to medium due to increases in covid-19 hospital admissions. Phillips County's admissions the week ending Tuesday translated to a rate of 16.9 per 100,000 residents, above the threshold of 10 per 100,000 that causes a county's level to be at least medium. Admissions in Baxter and Marion counties, which share a service area used by the CDC to calculate hospital metrics, translated to a rate of 13.6 per 100,000 residents. Under the previous weekly map update, all 75 of Arkansas' counties had been classified as having a low covid-19 level. The level remained low in 68 counties under Thursday's update. It was the 10th week in a row that no county in the state had a "high" covid-19 level, which triggers a recommendation that people wear masks in indoor public places. In counties with a medium level, the CDC recommends people who are immunocompromised or at high risk of severe covid-19 talk to their health care providers about whether they should wear masks or take other precautions. People in those counties also should consider wearing masks around people who have a high risk of severe illness, according to the CDC. In counties with low covid-19 levels, the CDC doesn't have a recommendation about whether people should wear masks. CASES BY COUNTY Pulaski County had the most new cases, 143, on Thursday, followed by Washington County with 43, Faulkner County with 41, Craighead County with 39 and Benton County with 35. The state's cumulative count of cases since March 2020 rose to 848,474. The Health Department's tally of vaccine doses that had been administered rose by 1,717, which was up by 321 from the daily increase a week earlier. About 64% of the most recent increase was from people receiving their first booster doses. The count of people starting the vaccination process rose by 304, which was up by 72 from the daily increase a week earlier. According to the CDC, the percentage of Arkansans who had received at least one dose remained Thursday at 67.2%, and the percentage who were fully vaccinated remained at 54.9%. The percentage of those fully vaccinated who had received a booster dose remained at 40.4%. Among the states and the District of Columbia, Arkansas continued to rank 37th in the percentage of its residents who had received at least one dose. In the percentage who were fully vaccinated, it remained roughly tied with Tennessee for 46th, ahead of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Wyoming. Nationally, 78% of people had received at least one dose, and 66.7% were fully vaccinated. Of the fully vaccinated population nationally, 47% had received a booster dose.

        WASHINGTON -- Democrats passed "red flag" firearm legislation in the U.S. House on Thursday without the help of Arkansas Republicans. The four House members from Arkansas voted against the bill, which allows a court to temporarily ban a person from possessing or buying a firearm if they are believed to pose a risk to themselves or others. If enacted, police, family and household members would be able to ask a court for an order temporarily prohibiting a person from purchasing or possessing firearms. Anyone requesting an order would have to submit a signed affidavit explaining why they think a person poses a risk. Supporters of "red flag" laws say the legislation has the ability to stop mass shootings and gun suicides. The push for tougher gun legislation comes in the aftermath of the elementary school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, which left 19 students and two teachers dead. U.S. Rep. Rick Crawford of Jonesboro said "red flag" laws are not the answer. "I don't think we solve our problems with firearms by attacking law-abiding citizens. This has the potential to do that," he said on Thursday. Thursday's measure, which passed the House by a 224-202 vote, is not likely to clear the Senate. Five House Republicans voted for the bill while one Democrat voted against it. A bipartisan group of senators have been in talks on how to respond to the shooting in Texas. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that approximately 10,000 petitions would come on a yearly basis under the bill. U.S. Rep. Lucy McBath, the sponsor of the legislation, said during debate Thursday that her bill would empower loved ones and law enforcement "to help prevent mass shootings before they happen." "Every family in every community in our nation deserves access to these life-saving measures. No child, no parent deserves to live in fear of gun violence," said McBath, a Georgia Democrat, during a speech on the House floor. "And we are paying for it. We're paying for this gun violence every single day. Day after day. Hour after hour." U.S. Rep. Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, spoke out against the bill during a speech on the House floor, saying it would allow courts to take firearms away from people without notice. Johnson said Democrats have refused "to work with us on legislation that would actually do something, that would actually reduce the rate of gun violence in this country." U.S. Rep. Steve Womack of Rogers on Thursday declined to comment to the Democrat-Gazette on why he voted against the "red flag" legislation. U.S. Rep. French Hill and U.S. Rep. Bruce Westerman were not available for an interview on Thursday. However, Westerman released a statement after the vote saying the bill "was an outright violation of Americans' due process right, which is a core tenet of our Constitution." In a statement on Wednesday, Hill of Little Rock said he did not support the "red flag" measure because "it infringes upon an individual's due process and Second Amendment rights." Arkansas gun safety advocates chided the state's U.S. House delegation for not voting for the bill. "By refusing to cross this line and come over to the side of reason, they are going to get more children killed and the blood will be on their hands," said Kate Fletcher, a longtime volunteer with the Arkansas chapter of Moms Demand Action, which advocates for gun safety legislation. Thursday's vote came one day after Arkansas' House delegation also voted against raising the purchasing age for semi-automatic weapons from 18 years old to 21 years old. They also voted against outlawing the selling, manufacturing and possession of large-capacity ammunition magazines with certain exceptions. The legislation passed the House in a near party-line vote. "It is baffling to me that our elected officials have decided to just absolutely ignore their constituents when we are screaming for them to do something to protect our communities," Fletcher said. Eve Jorgensen, a volunteer leader with the Arkansas chapter of Moms Demand Action, said many mass shooters show clear warning signs. "People around them know that that person is unstable. And yet time and again, they're able to go purchase a gun," she said. As for Thursday's vote from the House delegation, she said they "vote the way of the gun lobby." Nineteen states, not including Arkansas, have adopted "red flag" legislation, according to Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun safety advocacy organization. In 2019, so-called red flag legislation before the Arkansas Legislature failed in committee. There was not a major push for similar legislation during the 2021 legislative session, advocates said. Advocates for tougher gun laws also say "red flag" laws can cut off gun access to a person in crisis, preventing them from harming themselves. In 2020, Arkansas had the 8th-highest firearm death rate among U.S. states, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The rate includes homicides, suicides and other types of deaths. Womack, in a statement issued Wednesday after voting against the measure to raise the age for buying semi-automatic weapons, said the "focus needs to be on hardening schools, supporting mental health, expanding information sharing, and proactively identifying and halting threats." "Wish we could focus on what would actually make school safer for children instead of attacking the Second Amendment, which Democrats have obviously taken this opportunity to do that," Westerman said during an interview Wednesday on efforts to strengthen gun laws.

        The Arkansas State Medical Board voted to take no action at this time against a physician embroiled in a federal lawsuit over prescribing Washington County jail inmates ivermectin, an anti-parasitic medication some doctors have given as an off-label treatment for covid-19. During an April Medical Board meeting, board members told Dr. Robert Karas that a state investigator was unable to find consent forms in all but one of the inmate medical records that were reviewed. Four inmates are suing Karas, his health care company, the jail and the Washington County sheriff after they say they were unknowingly given "incredibly high doses" of ivermectin after contracting covid-19 last summer, according to court documents. The state Medical Board has not taken a stance on the off-label use of ivermectin as a treatment for covid-19. Instead the Board's investigation of Karas centered on informed consent and whether the detainees knew they were being given the de-wormer as part of a medication regimen for the virus. Several health agencies, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, advise against using ivermectin for the prevention and treatment of covid-19. "This is not about the chosen drug. This is about doing the right thing," Dr. Edward Garner, a board member, said during the April 7 meeting. "It is about permission." "I am surprised that our simple informed consent that we use on everybody and have for years, how that is getting missed on that many people," Karas said before the board in April. He added that after state and national media attention last year, he "did do a more thorough informed consent with all the medications and have them [detainees] sign specifically for each medication they were getting. "Thanks for not having an emergency suspension [of my medical license] or anything like that," Karas told the state Medical Board in April. Board members Thursday told Karas, who appeared with his attorney, Kyle Unser, that the physician had provided the information needed to clear up questions about consent. "There were some questions regarding the consent forms, the general consent to treat forms on some of these patients," Dr. Sylvia Simon, board chairman, said. "We've since gotten copies of those with explanations for why some of them actually appeared to be signed and some of them appeared to be more typed with covid regulations." "I think he has given us what we asked him to give," Simon said. "We had questions about the consent forms previously. We have got them now." During his roughly three-minute appearance Thursday, Karas said for "public record" he wanted to talk about the Washington County jail. "We have had 1,200 cases plus of covid there that we have documented with electronic medical records," he said. "We have a case fatality rate of zero percent. We have one hospital admission for two days on a patient who refused his meds. I tell people it is the safest place in the world to get covid." The lawsuit, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas on behalf of the four inmates in January, contends they were given ivermectin as early as November 2020 and didn't become aware of what the treatment was until last July. The lawsuit states they were told the treatment consisted of "vitamins," antibiotics," and/or "steroids," court documents said. It is unclear whether the federal lawsuit will move forward as both sides wait on a ruling by the judge on whether to dismiss the case. That decision could come as early as next week when a hearing is scheduled to discuss whether the case is moot because the inmates are no longer being held at the Washington County jail, said Gary Sullivan, ACLU of Arkansas legal director. Attorneys representing the plaintiffs are amending their claim to seek damages in lieu of injunctive relief as well as seeking to consolidate lawsuits with a fifth detainee also claiming no informed consent was given for ivermectin, Sullivan said. "Our best option would be the court ordered them to get informed consent from the detainees before they take ivermectin," Sullivan said. "We believe informed consent should include a clear statement that the use of ivermectin to treat covid is not sanctioned and also that the FDA has warned against its use. A person should be informed of that."  Print Headline: Doctor in ivermectin suit faces no action from board
