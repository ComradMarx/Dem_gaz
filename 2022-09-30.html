        Guardsmen training with machine guns at Camp Joseph T. Robinson on Friday morning ignited a fire that sent up a plume of smoke visible on both sides of the Arkansas River, although authorities said in a Facebook post Friday evening that it would burn out safely. There was no threat of the blaze leaving the confines of the base in North Little Rock, the post stated. "It will be smoky for a while until the fire burns itself out," according to the post. It was not clear exactly when or how the fire started, but the post stated that it began at a gun range near the center of the camp. A spokesperson for Camp Robinson had not returned a phone message as of Friday evening requesting further details about the cause and size of the fire. North Little Rock firefighters had not been called to assist with the fire as of Friday evening, spokesman Capt. Dustin Free said.

        The alleged robbery of a local teen at gunpoint outside his residence early Thursday has led to six arrests, including two juveniles, according to a Hot Springs police report. Calvin Kelowel Armond Ward, 20, who lists an Amity Road address, Quinton Cortez Bland, 22, who lists a Highway 290 address, Nicholas Allen Bland, 18, who lists a Cindy Street address, and Kyla Arise Betts, 19, who lists a Kansas City, Mo., address, along with the two juveniles, were all taken into custody shortly before 1 a.m. and each charged with aggravated robbery, punishable by up to life in prison. Betts, who was driving a car the suspects allegedly fled in, was also charged with felony counts of fleeing in a vehicle and first-degree endangering the welfare of a minor, each punishable by up to six years in prison, and a misdemeanor count of second-degree endangering the welfare of a minor, punishable by up to one year in jail. Ward, Betts, Quinton Bland and Nicholas Bland were all being held on zero bonds and are all set to appear on Oct. 31 in Garland County District Court, although they will likely be arraigned before then. The Sentinel-Record follows The Associated Press privacy policies and does not publish the names of juvenile offenders unless they are charged as adults. According to the probable cause affidavit, around 12:15 a.m. Thursday, the Garland County Sheriff's Office got a call from a woman about an armed robbery that had just occurred at her residence on Hershell Road. The woman said her son, 17, was outside the residence when somebody "took his stuff" and guns were involved. She also noted the suspects involved were leaving at that time in a white vehicle. Sheriff's deputies responding to the call spotted a white car traveling east on Airport Road at a high rate of speed and Deputy Michael Wagner activated his lights and siren to make a traffic stop, but the vehicle sped away and a pursuit ensued which ended in the parking lot of Walmart, 1601 Albert Pike Road. Six people were removed from the vehicle, a white 2002 Honda Civic, and a black and red AR-15 style rifle was reportedly seen in plain view inside the car. The persons in the vehicle were identified as Betts, the driver, and passengers, Ward, Quinton Bland, Nicholas Bland and two juveniles, ages not listed. Investigators spoke with the victim, who stated a female juvenile had texted him earlier in the evening "wanting to hang out." The girl arrived at his residence and the two of them were sitting in a vehicle parked in the driveway. At one point, the victim heard a knock on the car window and looked out to see a masked person holding a gun directing him to get out of the car. He noted there were "multiple subjects all with guns" standing outside. He noted one of the subjects was holding a red and black AR-15 rifle and the others were all holding handguns. The victim stated he was able to make it inside his residence and shut the door before the subjects could gain entry to his house. He noted that the female he had been with earlier left with the armed subjects. The victim mentioned Nicholas Bland, noting he didn't see his face, but thought he recognized his voice. The affidavit notes the residence on Hershell Road had surveillance cameras and investigators were able to obtain video of the incident which showed four of the subjects on the porch of the residence during the incident.

         Arkansas and five other states are suing the Biden administration over its plan to cancel some debt for those who took out loans to attend college, Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge announced Thursday. The lawsuit, filed Thursday in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri, alleges President Joe Biden violated federal law and exceeded his constitutional authority by issuing an executive order to cancel student debt for some borrowers. Rutledge said the states seek an immediate order from a federal judge to block loan forgiveness payments that could begin next week. Arkansas joins Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska and South Carolina in the lawsuit. Along with Biden, the lawsuit names the U.S Department of Education and Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona as defendants. "President Biden's unlawful political play puts the self-wrought college-loan debt on the backs of millions of hardworking Americans who are struggling to pay their utility bills and home loans in the midst of Biden's inflation," Rutledge said in a statement. "President Biden does not have the power to arbitrarily erase the college debt of adults who chose to take out those loans." Biden announced in August a plan to cancel student loan debt, following through on a campaign promise to provide relief to millions of Americans struggling to pay back student loans. Republicans criticized the idea, saying it was a political move by Biden to garner votes before the midterm elections. The program could wipe out the entirety of student loan debt for roughly 125,000 Arkansans. Under the proposal, borrowers could have up to $10,000 of their student loan debt forgiven. If the borrower qualified for Pell grants the amount of debt that could be canceled could be as much as $20,000. Biden's announcement drew unified criticism from Republican lawmakers in Congress who said Biden did not have the power to issue an executive order to cancel student loan debt. Biden said economic challenges from the covid-19 pandemic created a need to provide relief for those with student loan debt, citing a 2003 law that gives the federal government power to cancel debt after a disaster. The lawsuit cites an interview Biden did with CBS' 60 Minutes where he said "the pandemic is over" as evidence the executive order was an overreach, with the lawsuit stating no law allows the president "to unilaterally relieve millions of individuals from their obligation to pay loans they voluntarily assumed." Rutledge and other GOP attorneys general said the debt cancellation was a violation of the constitution's separation of powers and violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, saying any authority to cancel debt lies with Congress, not the president. For weeks, Republican lawyers looked for a way to sue the Biden Administration over the student debt plan, looking for standing. Rutledge who pledged to "take action" against the administration in a Fox Business interview in August, said Thursday that Arkansas found standing through the Arkansas Student Loan Authority, a division of the Arkansas Department of Commerce. "The state itself, through the student loan authority, finances student loans and administers those loans," said Dylan Jacobs, deputy solicitor general. "The mass debt cancellation will result in a significant drop in revenue that can be used for new student loans, financing." In Arkansas, there is $13 billion in student loan debt with 350,000 to 400,000 borrowers with the average borrower having $33,000 in debt, according to Tony Williams, director of the Arkansas Student Loan Authority. For Arkansans with student loan debt, Rutledge said borrowers should not be looking for relief from the federal government. "What I would say to Arkansans who took out student loans, that go to college, is to do what I did and pay off that student loan," Rutledge said. "This loan forgiveness, mass-debt cancellation, is going to fall on the backs of our plumbers, our electricians, our nurses, teachers, others who perhaps didn't have student loans." A White House spokesperson, Abdullah Hasan, said the lawsuit is an attempt to stop federal action that would provide relief to middle-class Americans. "Republican officials from these six states are standing with special interests and fighting to stop relief for borrowers buried under mountains of debt," Hasan told the New York Times. "The president and his administration are lawfully giving working- and middle-class families breathing room as they recover from the pandemic and prepare to resume loan payments in January." The lawsuit filed Thursday is not the first to try to halt Biden's student debt cancellation plan. On Tuesday, the Pacific Legal Foundation, a conservative legal group, announced a lawsuit against student debt forgiveness, saying taxpayers would have to fund the canceled debt, the New York Times reported. Republicans also have criticized the loan forgiveness plan's cost. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the program will cost $400 billion over the next three decades. The White House responded by saying the Congressional Budget Office's estimate of what the plan will cost in its first year, $21 billion, is less than what the Biden administration previously thought, according to reporting from The Associated Press. Gov. Asa Hutchinson, a critic of Biden's loan forgiveness plan, said in a statement he supports the state's lawsuit. "Broad student loan forgiveness is a misuse of executive authority," Hutchinson said. "Shifting the burden of $400 billion in arbitrary student loan forgiveness to all taxpayers is inconsistent with the American ideals of personal responsibility and fairness." Jesse Gibson, the Democratic nominee for attorney general, called the lawsuit partisan and a waste of state funds. "Our current Attorney General cannot help but file frivolous lawsuits based on political maneuvering and not what is best for Arkansas," Gibson said in a statement. "While hardworking Arkansans are paying her salary, she is joining in on a partisan attack." Republican candidate for attorney general and current Lt. Gov. Tim Griffin said he supported the lawsuit against Biden's student loan debt forgiveness plan. "President Biden's unilateral forgiveness of student loans is not only bad public policy, it also demands a legal challenge because the administration lacks authority for its action," he said. Before the lawsuit was filed Thursday, the U.S. Department of Education announced it would no longer forgive the federal student loan debt held by private companies, which could make it harder for Republican states to attack Biden's program in court, according to the New York Times. According to officials the change affects 770,000 people who hold that kind of debt out of 40 million who could still get some relief under the program. Information for the article was contributed by Ryan Anderson of the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Michael D. Shear of the New York Times and Seung Min Kim and Collin Binkley of The Associated Press.

         Arkansas Congressman Bruce Westerman filed a bill Thursday to reopen camping in the Albert Pike Recreation Area, where 20 people died in a flash flood in 2010. The U.S. Forest Service announced Dec. 16 that overnight camping wouldn't resume at Albert Pike, which is on the Little Missouri River in a remote and rugged section of the Ouachita National Forest in Montgomery County, about 50 miles west of Hot Springs. Westerman's bill calls for reopening campsites above what is known as the 100-year flood plain and developing at least 54 new campsites above the flood plain within two years. The 100-year designation means there is a 1% chance of flooding in any given year. "After the Forest Service's decision to permanently suspend all overnight camping at Albert Pike, I have heard from countless constituents who expressed their disappointment and frustration at the decision," Westerman said in a news release Thursday. "Albert Pike has been enjoyed by families from Arkansas, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Texas for generations. "We must ensure Albert Pike is safely refitted to ensure the 2010 tragedy never occurs again, but it would be a disservice to the community to permanently ban overnight camping and deprive folks who return to Albert Pike year after year to share the experiences they had as children with their families. I look forward to working with the U.S. Forest Service to allow for safe and responsible usage for years to come." According to an environmental assessment dated September 2021, all four campground loops in the Albert Pike Recreation Area are below the 100-year flood elevation, with Loop B close to the 25-year flood elevation, and Loops C and D located at or below the 10-year flood elevation (meaning there is a 10% chance of flooding in any given year). "The elevations of the Loop B, C, and D campgrounds averaged 1 to 7 feet below the computed 100-year flood high-water elevations," according to a study by the Forest Service's Southern Research Station in Asheville, N.C. Reached late Thursday,Westerman said, "If there are any individual campsites that are above the 100-year flood plain it would likely only be a few, but we wanted to make sure if there are any of those sites or if any are determined in future surveys that they would be made available for use as soon as possible." "There's certainly high ground around there that would be well out of the flood plain," he said. Westerman said he's been working with the Forest Service on his proposal to reopen the recreation area to overnight camping. "It's not like we came up with this on our own," he said. "We engaged with the Forest Service. I would love to see that campground developed and opened back up. We've got some real treasures on the Ouachita [National Forest]. I would like to see more recreational opportunities all across the forest." Westerman said he's in line to be chairman of the House Committee on Natural Resources, so he could help usher the bill through that committee. But it would probably be next year before the bill could work its way through the full House of Representatives, he said. Then it would go to the Senate. CAMPING BANNED Since the tragic flood along the Little Missouri River on June 11, 2010, the Forest Service has decommissioned about 25% of the developed campsites in the Ouachita National Forest -- all of the campsites that were below the 100-year flood plain, Tracy Farley, public affairs officer for the Ouachita National Forest, said in December. Since 2010, camping hasn't been allowed at the Albert Pike Recreation Area. The Forest Service wants it to stay that way. "The developed campsites at APRA are subject to floods of the magnitude that occurred on June 11, 2010, and for these reasons, camping below the 100-year flood elevation was not considered," according to the final decision notice signed by Lori Bell, acting forest supervisor. One of the alternatives considered would have allowed overnight tent camping above the 100-year flood elevation near Loop C, but that option was rejected. "Motorized emergency evacuation routes from the potential locations of the new tent campground would be located within the 100-year flood zone and could become flooded, entrapping overnight campers," according to the environmental assessment. In December, Farley said there are locations in Albert Pike's Loops A and B that are above the 100-year flood elevation, but those areas are too small to utilize as campsites. In the event of a flood, "those areas would be inaccessible and would have potential to cause the need for a swift water rescue," she said in an email at the time. Farley said the Forest Service didn't consider developing another campsite near but outside the Albert Pike Recreation Area because that wasn't part of its most recent analysis. "During the most recent environmental assessment of the Albert Pike recreation area, the scope was focused within the recreation area itself in order to meet standards and objectives identified in the Revised Land and Resource Management Plan for the Ouachita NF," she said in an email. WESTERMAN'S BILL The short title of Westerman's bill is the ''Ouachita National Forest Overnight Camping Act." According to the bill, within six months of its enactment, the secretary of agriculture shall identify areas within the Albert Pike Recreation Area that may be suitable for overnight camping. Within two years of the law's enactment, the secretary of agriculture is to review each of those areas, then "select and establish campsites and related facilities within Albert Pike Recreation Area for public use." The secretary shall ensure that at least 54 new campsites are available and that at least eight of them have electric and water hookups, according to Westerman's bill. Also, the secretary must ensure that each campsite and related facility is "located outside of the 1 percent annual exceedance probability flood elevation," otherwise known as the 100-year flood plain. Also, according to Westerman's bill, "Not later than 30 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall open each campsite within Albert Pike Recreation Area that -- (1) exists on the date of the enactment of this Act; and (2) is located outside of the 1 percent annual exceedance probability flood elevation." HISTORY The Albert Pike Recreation Area was developed by the U.S. Forest Service in 1934, beginning with the purchase of two parcels of lumber company land, according to the environmental assessment. Located 6 miles north of Langley in the southwest corner of Montgomery County, the recreation area has been a popular site for visitors from Arkansas, Oklahoma and Texas. This riverside recreation area became the subject of intense national, regional and local attention when the Little Missouri River overtopped its banks in the very early morning hours of June 11, 2010, generating a flash flood that killed 20 people, according to a Forest Service scoping letter dated Nov. 15, 2020. "The surviving family members and many others who were camping in the developed recreation area on June 10-11 also lost vehicles and other personal property in the flood," according to the letter. "An asphalt parking lot and connecting lanes, campsites, and bathhouses were heavily damaged, particularly in Loop D but also to some extent in Loop C, which was being reconstructed at the time." Many people "camp" in recreational vehicles. Loop D in the Albert Pike Recreation Area was the only one with RV hookups. Seventeen of the 20 people who died in the 2010 flood were camped in Loop D. For a decade, the Albert Pike Recreation Area was in limbo. A 2011 lawsuit and subsequent 2013 court order temporarily halted all modifications or alterations of facilities in the recreation area until the lawsuit was settled on July 20, 2018. Then, the Forest Service considered its options. Public meetings were held. Comments were solicited. The environmental analysis was drafted. After all the public comments, meetings and further analysis, Bell made her decision. "The decision provides a safe, well-maintained facility with year-round sustainable day-use recreation opportunities including swimming, picnicking and fishing," Caddo-Womble District Ranger Amanda Gee said in a December news release. The recreation area will continue to be day-use only, with no overnight camping permitted, according to the news release. Infrastructure will be decommissioned in some areas and allowed to return to natural conditions.  Print Headline: Westerman bill would reopen campgrounds at Albert Pike

         BENTONVILLE -- Former Benton County Judge Bruce Rutherford was honored Thursday when the county's Administration Building was dedicated in his honor. Rutherford died in 2017. Heather Rutherford unveiled the plaque honoring her late husband. The plaque is on a wall in the building's lobby. "On behalf of the Bruce Rutherford family and loved ones, I would like to sincerely thank everyone who has had a part in making this dedication possible," she said. Heather Rutherford said her husband had a passion for serving the residents of Benton County. "It was with great pride and joy that Bruce was able to contract this building without having to raise taxes on the citizens of Benton County," she said. "This building stands as one of Bruce's greatest achievements."  Bruce Rutherford served as county judge from 1989 to 1996, and he also worked as an investigator for the Benton County Prosecuting Attorney's Office from 2007 to 2017. He worked as Benton County sheriff's deputy from 1982 to 1988. He also was a Siloam Springs police officer. Benton County Judge Barry Moehring said it's fitting that the building is dedicated in Rutherford's honor since he was the driving force behind the construction. Rutherford was able to have the building constructed without raising taxes, Moehring said. David Clinger, a retired Benton County Circuit Judge, said he was thrilled at the building dedication and plaque honoring his friend. He said it's a fitting way to honor and recognize Rutherford's achievements for the county. "He would be so honored to have a dedication to cover his life's work," Clinger said. Debbie Herndon, who worked with Rutherford in the prosecuting attorney's office, said the building's dedication to Rutherford is a proud moment for his family and anyone who knew him. "I was honored to know Bruce Rutherford," Benton County Circuit Judge Robin Green said. "He had a true servant's heart and served Benton County for years in both law enforcement and administration. It is fitting that he is receiving this well deserved honor." The dedication ceremony was held before Thursday's Quorum Court meeting. Benton County justices of the peace voted 12-0 to increase the minimum pay for jail deputies to $20 per hour. Justice of the Peace Joseph Bollinger said the increase will be in the 2023 budget. The justices of the peace unanimously voted to appoint Lori Cottrell to the Benton County Planning Board.  Print Headline: Rutherford honored for years of work

         FAYETTEVILLE -- A planned expansion of a rock quarry west of Fayetteville failed to gain approval Thursday from the Washington County Planning Board. The board voted 3-2 in favor of a motion to recommend approval of a conditional use permit to add about 107 acres to the Farmington Quarry operation at 15557 Hamestring Road. The motion needed four affirmative votes to pass, according to Brian Lester, county attorney, which meant the permit application died and now must either be refiled with the county's Planning Department or the vote appealed to the Quorum Court. The quarry is owned by the Rogers Group. Andrew Effinger, an attorney for the Rogers Group, said after the meeting the company will consider all its options but the expansion plans will be pursued. The board had split on a motion to table the project, with three members in favor and three against. Board member Neil Helm said the county needed more time to consider the Farmington Quarry permit and he wanted to study what had happened in the two years since the county approved another quarry expansion for the Rogers Group for property east of Springdale. Helm said he is troubled that the complaints made by the neighbors of the Farmington Quarry echo concerns that were expressed about the Springdale project. "It's the same song, second verse," Helm said, "and it bothers me that this has to happen." The Farmington Quarry operation is surrounded by residential and agricultural property, according to the county Planning Department. Residents of the area, which is north of Wedington Drive, packed the Quorum Court meeting room to express their opposition to the planned expansion. More than 34 neighbors made written or verbal comments to the county in advance of Thursday's meeting, all opposing the expansion. The general concerns from neighbors included reduced property values, noise, disruption of animal habitat, disruption of private gatherings on properties in the area, concerns about blasting operations in the quarry affecting housing structure integrity, traffic safety and congestion and environmental concerns. Jennifer Baccellieri, one of the neighbors, said the current operation's rock blasting has terrorized children, pets and other animals in the area as well as caused physical damage to homes. She elaborated on her concerns in a email to the Planning Department. "With the current placement of the mine's excavation, we already feel a deep negative impact every time they blow dynamite for their operation," Baccellieri wrote. "It shakes the entire house strongly, even at the current placement. We have to prepare our house for essentially an earthquake because the house rattles so strongly. We do not want this mine to move any closer to us, as it would greatly affect our quality of life here on our property, which is our right to enjoy without such violent shaking from our neighbor. We also have farm animals on our property and it is very disturbing to our flocks. When we wake up in the morning, the first thing we hear is the sound of trucks beeping, like a constant construction zone. Even though we are out in the country trying to enjoy a natural life, we are already making sacrifices to live next to this mine. We absolutely do not want them to move any closer to us and make life very difficult for us on our beautiful property." Baccellieri told the board that property near the quarry currently serves as home to a faith-based community that advocates for organic farming, natural living and protecting nature. "Our property represents 50 families who enjoy regularly visiting and participating in educational and spiritual events," she said. "We do not want a loud mine moving closer to us and disrupting our activities on the property." Most of the neighbors offered similar complaints and concerns, likening the blasting operations at the quarry to earthquakes, detailing damage to homes and dangerous conditions created by 200 dump trucks a day driving on the narrow county road. According to information submitted by the company, the quarry has been in operation for more than 20 years. The additional land "simply extends the life of the existing quarry and doesn't alter the existing impacts on the public." According to the company's application, the expansion would "insure orderly development by supplying quality materials for the immediate area for the long term, eliminating the need for new quarries in the area." "These materials need to be very close to the end users," Effinger said of the long-term need for quarries in Northwest Arkansas. He said the expansion would actually move the quarry operation away from many residents. "We're moving further away from more people than we're moving closer to," he said. Effinger said the company had agreed to the same terms that were approved for the quarry expansion near Springdale, including forming a neighborhood committee and hiring an independent ombudsman to monitor the operation and facilitate communication between the company and the neighbors in the event there are complaints. "We'd like to get a vote on this," he told the board.  County zoning Land in unincorporated Washington County is zoned for agricultural or single-family residential use. All other uses require the property owner to obtain a conditional use permit through the countys planning process. The permits must be approved by the Washington County Planning Board and the Quorum Court. Source: NWA Democrat-Gazette     Print Headline: Farmington Quarry expansion fails; appeal possible

         FAYETTEVILLE -- A man who police say shot at three people in a car inside a Dickson Street parking garage last year pleaded guilty Monday to committing a terroristic act and other charges. Travean Billups, 23, of 66 W. Rainsong St. in Farmington, was sentenced by Washington County Circuit Judge Mark Lindsay to a total of 30 years at the Arkansas Department of Corrections after pleading guilty to terroristic threatening, first-degree battery, robbery, committing a terroristic act, failure to appear, aggravated assault on a household or family member, endangering the welfare of a minor and carrying a weapon. Billups received credit for jail time served back to June 24, 2021. Fayetteville police were sent to the parking garage at 609 W. Dickson St. on June 13, 2021, after reports of shots being fired, according to a preliminary report. Officers found several spent shell casings and signs of bullet impacts on a wall inside the garage. Video surveillance showed several vehicles and people had entered the garage and were involved in a fight. Two men entered the garage and ran to where the fight was occurring, according to the report. One of the men was holding a black handgun and wearing a light blue hat turned to the side. Police said the people who had been fighting were trying to leave in their vehicles when the man with the handgun began shooting. Three shots hit one of the vehicles. The driver continued out of the garage and later contacted police. The driver identified Billups as the man who had shot at her vehicle, according to the report. She said the shooting resulted from prior arguments. Billups also was arrested June 16, 2020, in connection with attempted capital murder and aggravated robbery, according to documents filed in Washington County Circuit Court and Washington County Detention Center records. The attempted murder charge was dropped as part of Billups' plea bargain. Police said at the time Billups had been involved in a drug deal that ended when he shot a man who had arranged to buy drugs from him. Billups was released June 26, 2020, on $100,000 bond on the attempted capital murder and aggravated robbery charges but failed to appear for a court date in July 2020. A warrant for his arrest was issued, and he was arrested for failure to appear July 14, 2020. He was released four months later on a $500,000 bond in connection with the failure to appear charges.

         FAYETTEVILLE -- A homeless man was arrested Monday after he reportedly threatened to burn down St. James Baptist Church. Dillon McDonald, 27, of Fayetteville, was arrested in connection with terroristic threatening, criminal trespass, open burning, public intoxication and possession of a controlled substance. He was being held Thursday in the Washington County Detention Center on $10,000 bond. According to a police report, a caller said a man, later identified as McDonald, had approached her and asked if she knew "this" -- referring to St. James -- was a Black church. The caller said the man, who was shirtless and wearing one yellow glove, said he was going to burn "this sucker down" and approached the church with a blanket filled with smoldering mulch and small shrubs. Police said an officer arrived on the scene and found a smoldering pile of debris in the parking lot north of the church. The officer said he saw a man, later identified as McDonald, climbing onto the roof of the nearby Circle K store. McDonald told police he was on the roof to bundle the cable. According to the report, McDonald admitted to setting the items in the parking lot on fire and then said the fire had already started, and he dragged the material away from the building. The blanket and the material set on fire was taken from the U-Haul business just north of the church, police said. McDonald was arrested and officers found a shirt and one yellow glove on the roof of the Circle K store. A matching yellow glove was found in the pile of burning material. Officers also found a plastic bag containing psilocybin mushrooms on the roof, according to the report.  Print Headline: Homeless man accused of threatening to burn church

         FAYETTEVILLE -- Police say they arrested a local man Wednesday night after he pointed a gun and threatened another man in the parking lot of a College Avenue restaurant. Harris Freeman, 20, of 4123 N. Cadillac Drive, No. 2, in Fayetteville, was arrested in connection with aggravated assault. Freeman was taken to the Washington County Detention Center, according to a preliminary report from the Fayetteville Police Department. Officers were sent to the Black Bear Diner at 4078 N. College Ave. around 7:15 p.m. Wednesday after receiving several calls reporting an armed person. Several callers said a white man was holding a Black man at gunpoint in the parking lot, according to the report. Officers spoke with the victim, who said he had been trying to back into a parking space when another car came around a corner and met his vehicle head-on. The man, whose name police did not release, told officers the driver of the second vehicle, later identified as Freeman, stopped in the parking lot. The man said he asked Freeman "what the problem was" and saw Freeman looking for something in his vehicle. Freeman retrieved a firearm from his vehicle and pointed it at the victim. Freeman got out of his vehicle and continued pointing the gun at the man, according to the report. The man said Freeman continued to point the weapon at him until he got back into his car and drove away. Witnesses inside the restaurant provided police video of the incident and a license plate number for a black Honda Civic. The car was registered to Freeman. Other officers saw Freeman's car enter a parking lot at 4201 N. Shiloh Drive and made a traffic stop. Police said they found a 9 mm handgun in the front passenger seat of the Honda. Freeman told police he had honked his horn at the other man because of the way he was driving. He said he feared for his safety and that his "problem solver" was in the car, so he grabbed his gun, exited his car and pointed the gun at the man, according to the report. Freeman told officers he spoke to the man, saying, "Are you willing to die?" and "If you touch me I will shoot you." He said he did not call the police because he had "solved the problem," according to the report.  Print Headline: Freeman accused of holding man at gunpoint

         FAYETTEVILLE -- Two men pleaded not guilty in Washington County Circuit Court on Wednesday to attempted capital murder and committing a terroristic act, related to a shooting incident in Springdale last month. Jamie Castro-Trujillo and Michael Adief Figueroa, both 18 of Springdale, were given Jan. 5 court dates before Circuit Judge Mark Lindsay. Springdale police responded to a call about a shooting around 1:30 a.m. Aug. 13 in the area of George Park but did not locate a victim or suspect. Officers found 12 spent shell casings just south of the park on Hylton Road and were advised a nearby residence on Butterfly Avenue had been struck, though no injuries to anyone inside the residence were reported, according to a Police Department news release. About 5:30 a.m., police received a call from a local hospital saying it was treating a 15-year-old male with a gunshot wound to his knee. The boy identified two men, Castro-Trujillo and Figueroa, as suspects in the incident, according to a police report. The boy told police he'd agreed to meet Castro-Trujillo at the park for a physical fight; as he drove up, he saw a red car parked just south of the park, then heard gunshots hitting his pickup, according to the report. The boy sped away, but he had been struck once in the right knee with a bullet, the report states. Figueroa admitted during an interview with detectives to shooting a Glock pistol at a pickup, according to the report.  Print Headline: Men plead not guilty to Springdale shooting

         The fiancee of the man shot to death in a Sherwood hospital on Wednesday told police that the gunman "asked how long they had been together" before opening fire, according to an arrest report from Sherwood police. Raymond Lovett, 24, of Little Rock was arraigned Thursday morning in Sherwood district court on capital murder and aggravated assault charges. He is charged in connection with the fatal shooting of Leighton Whitfield, 21, of North Little Rock. Judge Milas Hale set Lovett's bail at $500,000. According to a Sherwood Police Department arrest report, Jade Pye was a patient on the fourth floor of CHI St. Vincent Hospital North in Sherwood on Wednesday. She told police that Whitfield was visiting her when Lovett, who she referred to as "Ajay" arrived in the room. Pye told police that Lovett asked her and Whitfield how long they had been together and then he shot Whitfield. Lovett then pointed the gun at Pye, she said, until she pressed the emergency button on the hospital bed. He then left the room, the report states. Sherwood Police Chief Jeff Hagar said in a Wednesday afternoon news conference that Lovett and Whitfield knew each other, and the shooting appeared to be an isolated event. It was not clear from the report how Pye knew Lovett. Police responded to the report of shots fired at CHI St. Vincent just before 10 a.m. Wednesday, and then placed the hospital on lockdown, according to the Sherwood department. Officers said they found Whitfield dead from at least one gunshot wound. When the shots were fired, many of the hospital staff evacuated in line with their active shooter training, said Chad Aduddell, CEO of CHI St. Vincent, but two operations on the second floor continued through the incident because the surgeons deemed the procedures too important to interrupt. "I can't express in words how brave they were," Aduddell said of the hospital staff. Little Rock police were alerted that a "potential suspect" in the shooting was at Zimmerman's Exxon, 5223 S. University Ave., around 11 a.m. Wednesday. The gas station is located about 14 miles south of CHI St. Vincent in Sherwood. Appearing in court via video, Lovett pleaded innocent to the two charges Thursday morning. Hale ordered Lovett to have no contact with Pye. The order is set to remain in effect for one year unless the court modifies it. Lovett's next court date is set for Nov. 8. Information for this report was provided by Grant Lancaster of the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette.  Print Headline: $500,000 bail set in fatal shooting at hospital

         The Arkansas Supreme Court heard oral arguments Thursday challenging whether the Arkansas Department of Transportation can use sovereign immunity to avoid paying more than $18 million in attorneys' fees related to a lawsuit filed earlier this year by a group of taxpayers who successfully challenged the agency's spending on two major road construction projects. The Department of Transportation argued in a brief earlier this year that "winning an illegal exaction lawsuit should not be the equivalent of winning the lottery for the taxpayers' lawyers." Pulaski County Circuit Judge Chip Welch ruled from the bench in May that the legal team, led by Joe Denton and Justin Zachary of the law firm Denton & Zachary PLLC, should receive 15% of the $121,109,391.84 the Department of Transportation was required to reimburse to the so-called Amendment 91 fund, or $18,160,000. Denton & Zachary PLLC represents a group of taxpayers who sued the department and the other defendants in November 2018 for wrongfully spending proceeds from a 0.05% sales tax, authorized by Amendment 91 to the Arkansas Constitution, on road projects that exceeded the four-lane limit specified in the amendment. Voters approved the amendment in 2012. Attorney Kevin Arlen Crass, who represents the Department of Transportation, and Assistant Attorney General Vincent P. France argued that sovereign immunity protected the state from being forced to pay attorneys' fees. "This case will decide whether this money remains at the Department of Transportation to the benefit of the taxpayers or will it go to the private lawyers," Crass said during Thursday's proceedings, the first oral arguments of the fall that were held in the old Supreme Court Chamber in the State Capitol building. "I am sympathetic to the fact that they have earned a fee, but the law is pretty clear in my judgment and they took that risk." Crass said there is no dispute when it comes to the law of sovereign immunity protecting the state from paying attorneys' fees using tax dollars. "I am contending under the constitution of this state they are not entitled to a fee. That is my primary argument," he said. "We all take cases, and we analyze if there is a fee at the end, and the case law is pretty clear to me and they must have recognized it. If you reject the argument on that, then they are definitely not entitled to $18 million, and I will urge the court to look at the time that was spent and reflect on the hourly rates and award a reasonable fee." Sovereign immunity is addressed in Article 5, Section 20, of the Arkansas Constitution, which states Arkansas "shall never be made a defendant in any of her courts." "The question whether there should be a fee attached to an illegal exaction case is one of public policy. It should be decided on the floor above us," Crass said. "And in fact, in 1977 that is what those legislators upstairs did." Associate Justice Courtney Hudson asked Crass and France if this means they are seeking to give the attorneys who represented the taxpayers nothing. "They knew sovereign immunity exists and they knew the risks," Crass said while acknowledging the attorneys probably deserve some payment but that $18 million was too much. "... I know it sounds harsh ... but law can be harsh. I would advocate change if I was a policy maker, but I am not." At the least, they added, the court should modify the trial court's fee award to reflect the total hours worked based on "a reasonable hourly rate." "I know we get numb to the dollars, and millions doesn't seem to mean as much as it did when I first started practicing law, but $18 million coming from the state taxpayers is too much money," Crass said. "It is within your providence to say whether that's excessive, and I urge you to say that it is." France said if the 15% decision is upheld, it would mean attorneys' fees would equal around $23,000 to $24,000 an hour for 771 hours of work. The amount of money also gave some justices pause, as they asked about hourly rates and wondered aloud about the high price tag associated with the attorneys' fees. "I look at this $18 million, frankly, it makes me think the court affirms that I should step down from my job because I think I would be better suited spending my time asking the state government in Arkansas to account for funds on a regular basis and you walk away with millions," Associate Justice Rhonda Wood said. "That is the type of message this sends." Zachary, who represented the appellees in the case, argued Thursday that his team worked almost daily on the case and gave the accurate number of hours. "We did everything we could to win," he said. "We could have padded our hours, but we didn't." Zachary said the argument is supported by the Supreme Court, and it would discourage other members of the public from taking on state entities because of fear of having to pay out of pocket. "A constitutional tax does not have the same oversight as one passed through the General Assembly," he said. "The only oversight is the public's ability to file suit." Wood said the issue of sovereign immunity was a decision made by the legislative body, and to overturn that concept would mean the court would be getting into the policy-making business. "The Legislature is a policy-making arm, not the Supreme Court," she said. "While we are sympathetic to the work that you did on the behalf of citizens, those policy arguments are better suited for that arm of government. If they passed a statutory provision for attorney fees and left this out, and then for us to come in and say we don't like this policy decision of the Legislature then we are going to make a different one, how is that allowed?" Zachary said the question deserves to be looked at by the Supreme Court because allowing the state to use sovereign immunity in this instance will discourage other lawyers from taking such cases. "If the people of this state don't have the ability to hire a private lawyer, then they aren't going to be able to bring these suits," he said. "It would be a discouragement." Wood asked if that was the role of the court. "I think we have here a constitutional right to institute suits against the state and the remedies go along with it, whether that be refunds, reimbursement or attorneys' fees," Zachary said. "You have to be able to fully bring the suit." The lawsuit at the heart of the argument focused on only two of the projects benefiting from Amendment 91 money under the department's Connecting Arkansas Program, a $1.8 billion road construction program focusing on regionally significant projects. Those projects were 30 Crossing -- a $1 billion project that will widen a 6.7-mile section of Interstate 30 through downtown Little Rock and North Little Rock to up to 10 lanes in places, as well as replace the I-30 bridge over the Arkansas River -- and the widening of a 5.5-mile section of Interstate 630 in west Little Rock to eight lanes. Both segments were already six lanes. Welch initially accepted the state defendants' arguments that the wording of the amendment was similar to terms that department officials regularly employed when discussing major routes and lumped them together in the four-lane grid system even though some were wider than four lanes. But the Arkansas Supreme Court vacated Welch's ruling and said the spending on those projects from Amendment 91 money amounted to "illegal exaction" under the Arkansas Constitution, and had to be refunded because the wording of the amendment limited the money to four-lane roads or roads that were to be widened to four lanes, a notion that the department vigorously disputed. The high court returned the case to Welch. In February 2021, Welch gave the Department of Transportation 60 days to reimburse the Amendment 91 account $121 million, which was the amount of Amendment 91 money spent on the projects before the Supreme Court ruling. Department of Transportation Director Lorie Tudor crafted a reimbursement plan that involved making "journal entries" in which the Amendment 91 money spent on the 30 Crossing and I-630 projects was assigned to eight other projects. Those projects were no wider than four lanes and already had been completed. The regular state and federal road construction money that was spent on that work was applied to the 30 Crossing and I-630 projects. Tudor testified the changes were aboveboard and would pass the review of state and federal auditors. A top executive at the state finance department offered similar testimony. Crass said the Arkansas Department of Transportation's only option to reimburse the fund was to use the journal entries since the money had already been paid out to contractors. He said because of that, there was no pot of money for attorneys fees to be paid from when it comes to the lawsuit, which means it would come from taxpayers. "It's coming from the state's coffers, and your case law makes it very clear when that is the case the percentage approach is not appropriate," Crass said. "The $18 million is so excessive it goes back to an old standard review that it shocks the conscious. It's too much money." The Supreme Court will issue its opinion in the coming weeks.

         The new attorney for a Yellville man charged in connection with the U.S. Capitol riot said Thursday that he will decide soon whether his client should take a plea offer or go to trial. Joseph William Allen of Branson filed a notice Sept. 14 in federal court in the Distinct of Columbia indicating he would be serving as attorney for Jon Thomas Mott, 39, of Yellville. Mott was previously represented by Michelle M. Peterson, a public defender in Washington, D.C. Mott faces four misdemeanor charges stemming from the Jan. 6, 2021, breach of the U.S. Capitol: Entering and remaining in a restricted building; disorderly and disruptive conduct in a restricted building; violent entry and disorderly conduct in a Capitol building; and parading, demonstrating or picketing in a Capitol building. In a teleconference status hearing Thursday from federal court in the District of Columbia, Assistant U.S. Attorney Graciela Rodriguez Lindberg said a plea offer was extended to Mott last year. "I don't mind leaving that offer open or at least getting another offer on the table," she said. "That one has technically expired, but we can work on that." Lindberg said that since Allen is new on the case, he may need some time to pore over the extensive discovery related to the Capitol riot. "Just for the record, as of September 16 of this year ... we have over 3.37 million files related to the Capitol riot discovery in the defense Relativity workspace," Lindberg told U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth during Thursday's hearing. She said the video footage alone would take 100 days to watch straight through without taking a break. "I'm aware of the larger discovery available," Allen told the judge. "Of course I'm new to the case. However, I've been trying to focus on peeling back the layers of discovery as it is specific to Mr. Mott's case. So I believe that I am pretty well up to speed and I do have access to the discovery." Allen said he has spoken extensively with Mott and has been in contact with attorneys for the federal government. Allen said he needed a little more time, so Lamberth set the next status hearing for Nov. 17. If both sides come to an agreement regarding a plea, a court date can be set earlier, Lamberth said. If the case goes to trial, Lindberg estimated it would take a week including jury selection. Last Friday, Allen asked the judge to allow Mott to use his legally owned guns to go hunting. "For the majority of his life, Defendant has participated in the Conservation efforts of wildlife management by engaging in the practice of subsistence hunting," Allen wrote in the motion. "This practice also contributes toward supplementing the monies spent by the Defendant toward groceries for an average annual estimate of $5,000.00 in savings." Lamberth granted that request Monday, but Mott isn't allowed to keep firearms or ammunition at his home or workplace. One condition of Mott's pretrial release was that he not possess firearms. The Jan. 6 riot escalated from a "Stop the Steal" rally when some supporters of then-President Donald Trump entered the U.S. Capitol and attempted to stop Congress from certifying the Electoral College vote indicating that Joe Biden had won the presidential election. Richard "Bigo" Barnett, 62, of Gravette, and Peter Francis Stager, 43, of Conway face felony charges in connection with the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol. Stager remains in the District of Columbia jail. He is the only Jan. 6 defendant from Arkansas still incarcerated. Mott, Barnett and Stager have all pleaded innocent. Robert Thomas Snow, 78, of Heber Springs pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge for "parading, demonstrating or picketing in the Capitol building." He was sentenced to probation and community service.  Print Headline: D.C. riot suspect weighs plea offer

         Arkansas' coronavirus metrics continued to indicate a slowing spread of the virus Thursday as the number of people hospitalized with covid-19 in the state fell to its lowest level in three months. The state's death toll from the virus, as tracked by the Department of Health, rose by 17, to 12,148. State Epidemiologist Mike Cima said six of the deaths reported Thursday happened within the past month. Of the others, he said, three were from July and eight were from earlier in August. Dropping by double digits for the second day in a row, the number of covid-19 patients in the state's hospitals fell Thursday by 19, to 231, the smallest number since June 28. The state's count of cases rose by 343 -- smaller by 156 than the increase on Wednesday and less than half the size of the rise the previous Thursday. It was the smallest daily increase in cases on a Thursday since May 12. In another sign of a slowdown in new infections, Cima said 8.8% of the state's coronavirus cases were positive over the week ending Wednesday, the first time in months the percentage over a seven-day span had been below 10%. "It just seems that the trend is that transmission is slowing," Cima said. "We're seeing less cases, less hospitalizations, diminishing positivity, so I think all those things taken to together just paint the picture that we're headed in the right direction right now." The state has seen a rise in reported deaths, although many of the deaths that have recently been reported happened weeks ago. Over the seven-day spans ending Wednesday and Thursday, the average number reported a day was about 15 -- the highest average since late March. When deaths are examined by the death the date occurred, rather than when it was reported, it appears the number peaked in late July at an average of eight or nine a day, Cima said. That number could change, however, as more deaths are reported. "It may be that we are actually decreasing in the frequency of deaths, day to day, but we we won't really know that for a couple weeks because of the delay associated with reporting those," Cima said. Pulaski County had the most new cases, 65, on Thursday, followed by Washington County with 37 and Benton County with 28. The state's cumulative count of cases since March 2020 rose to 951,283. Declining for the 16th straight day, the average daily increase in the state's case count over a rolling seven-day period fell to 363, the first time it had been below 400 since the week ending June 3. Already at its lowest level since June 7, the number of cases in the state that were considered active fell by 303, to 5,137, as recoveries outpaced new cases. After rising the previous two days, the number of the state's virus patients who were in intensive care remained Thursday at 47. Growing for the second day in a row, the number on ventilators rose by four, to 17. At its hospitals in Little Rock and Springdale, Arkansas Children's had eight covid-19 patients on Thursday, the same number it had the previous Thursday, spokeswoman Amanda Leech said. MAP UPDATED Reflecting declines in new cases and hospital admissions for covid-19, the number of Arkansas counties where the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people wear masks in indoor public places fell from eight to two under a weekly update on Thursday to the agency's map of "covid-19 community levels." The levels -- low, medium or high -- are based on weekly numbers of new cases, hospital admissions for covid-19 and the percentage of staffed hospital beds that are occupied by covid-19 patients. The level fell from high, meaning masks are recommended, to medium in Cleburne, Jackson, White and Woodruff counties on Thursday and from high to low in Craighead and Hot Spring counties. Arkansas and Monroe counties, which share a service area used by the CDC to calculate hospital metrics, were the only counties where the level remained high. Admissions for covid-19 in the two eastern Arkansas counties the week ending Thursday translated to a rate of 37.2 per 100,000 residents -- above the threshold of 20 per 100,000 that causes a county's level to be high regardless of its number of new cases. Overall, the number of counties with a low covid-19 level rose Thursday by 28, to 59, while the number with a medium level fell by 22, to 14. Among the state's most populous counties aside from Craighead, the level fell from medium to low in Pulaski, Sebastian, Faulkner and Saline counties and remained low in Benton and Washington Counties. In counties with a medium covid-19 level, the CDC recommends that people who are immunocompromised or at high risk of severe covid-19 talk to their health care providers about whether they should wear masks or take other precautions. People in those counties also should consider wearing masks around people who have a high risk of severe illness, according to the CDC. In counties with a low covid-19 level, the CDC doesn't have a recommendation about whether people should wear masks.  Print Headline: Covid infections slow in Arkansas

         Crews are expected to close two downtown Little Rock streets this weekend as part of Interstate 30 construction. Weather permitting, state officials plan to close Third Street between Ferry and Mahlon Martin streets from 6 p.m. today to 5 a.m. Monday. McGowan Street is scheduled to temporarily close starting Saturday, according to news releases from the Arkansas Department of Transportation. The closures are part of the 30 Crossing project, a multiyear endeavor by the Department of Transportation to expand and improve access to I-30 in the downtown Little Rock and North Little Rock area. State officials have so far contracted out $633 million for the first phase of the project, according to Dave Parker, spokesman for the department. The Third Street closure will allow crews to continue demolishing the defunct I-30 bridge that carried traffic across the Arkansas River until earlier this month. Over the weekend, westbound traffic on Third Street headed toward I-30 should take a right on Dean Kumpuris Street. Drivers should then take a left at President Clinton Avenue and pass under I-30. At Sherman Street, traffic should take another left and continue until they reach Third Street. Eastbound traffic on Third Street should take this route in reverse order, according to a detour announced by the Department of Transportation. Crews will also close McGowan Street to begin the construction of a single-lane on-ramp that will connect the I-30 westbound frontage road to I-630 westbound. The frontage road on-ramp to I-30 westbound and the on-ramp from I-30 westbound to I-630 westbound are expected to remain open, according to the department. News releases from the department have not specified an end date for the temporary closure of McGowan Street. Drivers on the westbound I-30 frontage road should take a right at 11th Street to avoid the McGowan Street closure. Traffic should then take a left onto McMath Avenue to access the William H. Bowen School of Law at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock and Pulaski County Lane. Earlier this month, state officials shifted traffic onto a newly constructed bridge spanning the Arkansas River. Crews are now demolishing the aging I-30 bridge, a process state officials expect to take around 10 months. Once the four-stage demolition is complete, state officials plan to construct a new bridge in place of the old bridge that will ultimately carry westbound I-30 traffic across the river. State officials urged those traveling through the work zone to be cautious and expect slower traffic speeds.  Print Headline: 2 Little Rock streets to close this weekend for I-30 work

         Little Rock Chief Deputy City Attorney Alex Betton, who was recently tasked with overseeing the city's responses to Arkansas Freedom of Information Act requests, will resign, officials said Thursday. Mayor Frank Scott Jr.'s spokesman Aaron Sadler confirmed Betton is leaving his position. "Alex is an asset to all of us at City Hall," Scott said in a statement provided by Sadler. "I value his legal expertise and trusted counsel, and I'm grateful for his willingness to take over the FOIA Division. I'm glad he will stay on until the end of the year, and I'm excited about the new opportunity for public service that awaits him." When asked when Betton's last day will be, officials could not immediately provide an exact date. Betton was named chief deputy city attorney in February 2019 after an interim period spent in the same role following the departure of longtime Little Rock employee Bill Mann, who now works for the Arkansas Municipal League. He previously served as an assistant city attorney from 2010 to 2012, then left for the prosecuting attorney's office of the 6th Judicial District, which covers Pulaski and Perry counties, according to Betton's LinkedIn page. Betton returned to the Little Rock city attorney's office in March 2016. An email requesting comment that was sent to Betton as well as Little Rock City Attorney Tom Carpenter was not returned Thursday. Betton's resignation was first reported by Mitch McCoy of KARK. As a result of a records-act overhaul Scott announced on Aug. 9, the city's open-records division was removed from the Department of Human Resources and Betton was placed in charge. News of Betton's forthcoming departure broke two days after members of the Little Rock Board of Directors spent two hours in executive session to discuss what Scott called "a personnel issue that requires immediate attention." City board members exercise direct oversight over just two employees, the city manager and city attorney. Carpenter on Wednesday confirmed that he was present during the executive session the day before. Betton's resignation also comes as the city is dealing with issues on several fronts related to open-records compliance. A little more than two weeks after Scott announced the records-act overhaul, Prosecuting Attorney Larry Jegley of the 6th Judicial District issued a letter to the city that asked officials to "fully comply" with two records requests submitted by a Conway man or provide an alternative explanation. Carpenter later told Jegley that the city's responses to the requestor, Jimmie Cavin, were complete. Last week, Matthew Campbell, a local attorney who authors the "Blue Hog Report" blog, filed a records-act complaint against Little Rock in which Campbell claimed he was never provided records in response to three requests he submitted earlier this month. Additionally, on Wednesday, Campbell shared to Twitter a copy of an email he received from Carpenter in which Carpenter told Betton that an "IT pull" had revealed "numerous documents" pertaining to a coming city festival were deleted. The first-ever festival, dubbed LITFest, has been scheduled for Oct. 7-9. Events are being produced in partnership with an outside public affairs firm that employs Charles Blake, Scott's former chief of staff.

         An El Dorado circuit judge on his third term has agreed to accept a two-month unpaid suspension rather than go through the public censure process by challenging misconduct accusations against him, judicial regulators announced Thursday. David Sachar, executive director of the state Judicial Discipline and Disability Commission, revealed the sanctions he seeks against Robin Carroll, 51, in an 18-page news release. The Arkansas Supreme Court will have to approve the disciplinary action. Carroll's acquiescence to the allegations -- violations of 10 canons of the Code of Judicial Conduct -- render them to be considered proven, according to his sanctioning letter. "The totality of your conduct ... exhibited a disregard for legal procedures, failure to uphold the integrity of the judiciary, and behavior that undermined public confidence in the office of circuit court judge," the letter states. "You agree that you committed acts in violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct and that your actions were unethical. You are prohibited from refuting those truths, criticizing this agreed settlement, or otherwise denigrating or disparaging the [discipline commission's] investigation, the witnesses or complainants, or the outcome of these cases." The sanctions call for three months without pay with one month held in abeyance for a year on the condition that if Carroll commits further violations, the judicial discipline commission will seek to have that third month without pay imposed. Carroll is one of the six judges of the six-county 13th Judicial Circuit of Calhoun, Cleveland, Columbia, Dallas, Ouachita and Union counties. He presides over criminal cases in Calhoun, Dallas, Ouachita and Union counties as well hearing civil cases in Calhoun, Cleveland, Columbia, Ouachita and Union counties. He also handles some probate cases in Calhoun County. Licensed since 1996, Carroll was elected in 2012 without opposition after serving as the circuit's elected prosecutor for two terms before running for the Union County-based judgeship. He won re-election in 2014 and 2020 also without facing a challenger. The position pays $180,129 a year, about $15,000 per month. He was recognized as one of Arkansas Business magazine's 40 under 40 in 2001 when he was 30 years old in private practice while serving as legal counsel for the state Democratic Party, writing a newspaper column and preparing to take over as president of the El Dorado Rotary Club. In 1997, he was named one of the 10 Outstanding Young Arkansans by the Arkansas Junior Chamber of Commerce. The commission's investigation found three instances in which Carroll improperly dismissed cases, demonstrated bias and failed to recuse himself, tried to improperly influence state Game and Fish Commission cases in other courts or showed a lack of diligence in record-keeping and docket management. The first instance was in August 2021 involving Carroll's conflict with an unnamed sheriff's deputy in an undisclosed county, the sanction letter states. Carroll had earlier told the sheriff that the deputy should be fired and that he had known the deputy since Carroll was a prosecutor. Carroll also contacted the local public defender and said he would dismiss any criminal case involving that deputy if the lawyer asked for it. Carroll further ignored prosecution objections after the judge prompted the defense in court to ask the cases be dismissed. "Because these cases are based on the testimony and work of [deputy], who has zero credibility with myself or the prosecutor's office, these -- all these cases -- will be dismissed," the judge said in open court. "[And] any other private counsel who has cases that are based on the testimony of [the deputy], if he's the sole witness, those cases will also be dismissed." Judicial regulators found that Carroll demonstrated impropriety and "had stepped into the role of defense counsel ... and inappropriately claimed to speak on behalf of one of the parties. [He] did not ensure the proper administration of justice and failed to instill public confidence in the independence, integrity, and impartiality of the judiciary." The Game and Fish accusations involve a wildlife officer ticketing someone for hunting turkeys with bait in April 2021. The citation was assigned to a district court judge but Carroll contacted that judge and discussed the agency's case in detail, prompting the lower court judge to recuse. In January, Carroll called and texted Col. Brad Young, the agency's enforcement chief, referencing two other cases, stating that "needs to go away before trial" because the case would embarrass the agency. He also endorsed the unnamed defendant. Carroll further contacted other Game and Fish officials, the defendant, the defendant's lawyer as well as the special prosecutor to question the legality of a related search. The defense used those legal arguments at trial and the defendant was acquitted. "The reasonable expectations of the public would certainly include the belief that a judicial officer will not make an overt ... attempt to influence the outcome of any case to the detriment of any party," the sanctioning letter states. "Few things are more damaging to the judiciary than stories of special treatment for some and not others." The third sanctioning violation involves sloppy record keeping and a sometimes erratic court schedule that saw Carroll failing to hear his full docket and canceling court "numerous" times without notice, which sometimes caused criminal defendants to not receive appropriate hearing notices.

         A 39-year-old Alexander man charged with rape was cleared of wrongdoing by a Pulaski County jury on Wednesday. Nathaniel Collier faced a potential life sentence on the Class Y felony charge. The eight women and four men deliberated about 90 minutes to acquit him during the one-day trial before special Circuit Judge Chris Piazza. Jurors heard from Collier's accuser about their November 2015 encounter in Little Rock as well as a second woman who said Collier had sexually assaulted her during a 2014 incident she never reported to police. There was no dispute that the 36-year-old accuser and Collier had sex at her Little Rock apartment, which was confirmed by the discovery of Collier's DNA from bodily fluids found on the woman's body and underwear. Collier also did not dispute that he and the second woman had sex during an overnight camping date, although he told jurors it was all consensual. She said she only came forward after learning Collier was being charged with rape in 2018, telling jurors it took her years to come to terms with what Collier had done to her. Prosecutors contended that Collier had taken advantage of the rape accuser when she was emotionally vulnerable -- her dog had died and she'd lost her job -- to force himself on her repeatedly during the overnight encounter about 1 ½ weeks before Thanksgiving 2015. But defense attorney Bill James told jurors that what really happened is the woman was angry that a one-night stand with a former fling did not develop into the romantic relationship she wanted, describing the two as "friends with benefits." He told jurors the woman told conflicting stories about what happened to police and medical personnel. "In the end, she had some 'buyer's remorse' and she didn't get what she wanted," James said. "How many lies are you going to accept on the way to a conviction? Why can't she just tell the truth?" James, with co-counsel Alex Morphus and Hayley Ferguson, told jurors the defense version of events made more sense than the prosecution's case. Collier is a good, honest man who suffers from anxiety and post-traumatic stress syndrome induced by his two tours of duty as a Marine in Iraq and Kuwait, he told jurors. He asked jurors to question why the woman had invited Collier over after she testified she ended the pair's previous relationship, begun when she was about 22, after six weeks because of Collier's temper and propensity for being rough. They did not have personal contact for years but remained in touch through Facebook. "Why would you invite someone like that to your house? Why would you want someone like that knowing where you live? It defies logic," James told jurors. "She invited him to her house because she knows who he is." Prosecutors told jurors Collier reached out to the woman through social media while she was depressed, resulting in her inviting Collier to "hang out" at her apartment one night for simple companionship. They said the woman has never substantially wavered in her account of what Collier did to her, painting him as a cold and calculating predator who waited until she was alone to sodomize her then waited again until she had fallen asleep to rape her once more before leaving. "Mr. Collier knew what he was doing," deputy prosecutor Justin Harper said. "He was going over there to get drunk and rape [her]." Collier physically intimidated her into keeping quiet and not fleeing the apartment or otherwise calling for help, with the woman waiting until he had left to go to police, Harper said. "She was scared. That's reasonable. She did what she thought was best," deputy prosecutor Beth Kanopsic said. Is it reasonable to think the woman is pursuing a vendetta against Collier, or is it more likely that she's a true victim, trying to hold her attacker accountable, Kanopsic asked jurors. "Why would she make this up? Why would she submit to a rape exam?" Kanopsic asked. "Why would she subject herself to seven years of the court system and then come in here and testify in front of strangers?" Collier, who spent about 36 minutes on the witness stand, told jurors she was a willing partner. "One thing led to another and we started kissing and had sex [the first time] on the couch," he said. The woman went to bed a short time later and Collier said he followed, telling jurors they slept together but woke up later and again, "it kind of mutually happened. We were spooning in bed." A self-employed computer network technician, Collier told jurors he and the woman had never had a romantic relationship. He said they had been "friends with benefits" in a casual sexual relationship when they were younger but that faded away when he met a woman he wanted to pursue romantically. The woman spent about an hour testifying and answering questions, telling jurors she had met Collier through their participation in a local volleyball team. She told jurors they had dated before, which she ended after about six weeks because he was aggressive and possessive to the point of stalking her, saying she broke things off because of his propensity for rough sex. The woman told jurors she had hoped Collier had matured when she invited him to her apartment, saying she expected her roommate and the roommate's guest to be staying, but they left after Collier arrived. She said she made it clear to Collier that she was not interested in sex, saying she was shocked when he suddenly kissed her. When she resisted, he grabbed her, pushed her down on the couch and sodomized her, the woman said, telling jurors she was afraid to fight back and hoped that he would leave without hurting her further. In cross-examination, she acknowledged there were times she could have escaped or called out for help. "I had a better chance if I complied ... if I didn't do anything," she said, testifying that she was "frozen" and "almost comatose" with fear. "All I could think of is, wait until he leaves. I was just trying to make it through the night."  Print Headline: Jury clears Alexander man of rape

         FAYETTEVILLE -- A man who police say shot at three people in a car inside a Dickson Street parking garage last year pleaded guilty Monday to committing a terroristic act and other charges. Travean Billups, 23, of 66 W. Rainsong St. in Farmington, was sentenced by Washington County Circuit Judge Mark Lindsay to a total of 30 years at the Arkansas Department of Corrections after pleading guilty to terroristic threatening, first-degree battery, robbery, committing a terroristic act, failure to appear, aggravated assault on a household or family member, endangering the welfare of a minor and carrying a weapon. Billups received credit for jail time served back to June 24, 2021. Fayetteville police were sent to the parking garage at 609 W. Dickson St. on June 13, 2021, after reports of shots being fired, according to a preliminary report. Officers found several spent shell casings and signs of bullet impacts on a wall inside the garage. Video surveillance showed several vehicles and people had entered the garage and were involved in a fight. Two men entered the garage and ran to where the fight was occurring, according to the report. One of the men was holding a black handgun and wearing a light blue hat turned to the side. Police said the people who had been fighting were trying to leave in their vehicles when the man with the handgun began shooting. Three shots hit one of the vehicles. The driver continued out of the garage and later contacted police. The driver identified Billups as the man who had shot at her vehicle, according to the report. She said the shooting resulted from prior arguments. Billups also was arrested June 16, 2020, in connection with attempted capital murder and aggravated robbery, according to documents filed in Washington County Circuit Court and Washington County jail records. The attempted murder charge was dropped as part of Billups' plea bargain. Police said at the time Billups had been involved in a drug deal that ended when he shot a man who had arranged to buy drugs from him. Billups was released June 26, 2020, on $100,000 bond on the attempted capital murder and aggravated robbery charges but failed to appear for a court date in July 2020. A warrant for his arrest was issued, and he was arrested for failure to appear July 14, 2020. He was released four months later on a $500,000 bond in connection with the failure to appear charges.

         FAYETTEVILLE -- Police say they arrested a man Wednesday night after he pointed a gun and threatened another man in the parking lot of a College Avenue restaurant. Harris Freeman, 20, of 4123 N. Cadillac Drive, No. 2, in Fayetteville, was arrested on a charge of aggravated assault. Freeman was taken to the Washington County jail, according to a preliminary report from the Fayetteville Police Department. Officers were sent to the Black Bear Diner at 4078 N. College Ave. around 7:15 p.m. Wednesday after receiving several calls reporting an armed person. Several callers said a white man was holding a Black man at gunpoint in the parking lot, according to the report. Officers spoke with the victim, who said he had been trying to back into a parking space when another car came around a corner and met his vehicle head-on. The man, whose name police did not release, told officers the driver of the second vehicle, later identified as Freeman, stopped in the parking lot. The man said he asked Freeman "what the problem was" and saw Freeman looking for something in his vehicle. Freeman retrieved a firearm from his vehicle and pointed it at the victim. Freeman got out of his vehicle and continued pointing the gun at the man, according to the report. The man said Freeman continued to point the weapon at him until he got back into his car and drove away. Witnesses inside the restaurant provided police video of the incident and a license plate number for a black Honda Civic. The car was registered to Freeman. Other officers saw Freeman's car enter a parking lot at 4201 N. Shiloh Drive and made a traffic stop. Police said they found a 9 mm handgun in the front passenger seat of the Honda. Freeman told police he had honked his horn at the other man because of the way he was driving. He said he feared for his safety and that his "problem solver" was in the car, so he grabbed his gun, exited his car and pointed the gun at the man, according to the report. Freeman told officers he spoke to the man, saying, "Are you willing to die?" and "If you touch me I will shoot you." He said he did not call the police because he had "solved the problem," according to the report.  Print Headline: Fayetteville man arrested in restaurant assault

         LITTLE ROCK -- Two motions seeking to dismiss a lawsuit challenging the legitimacy of a casino license in Pope County granted to Legends Resort and Casino by the Arkansas Racing Commission were denied Wednesday by a judge in Pulaski County who said the plaintiff in the case has standing to take the issue to court and that he has presented factual allegations that present a constitutional question in the matter. Pulaski County Circuit Judge Wendell Griffen denied the two motions, filed by the Arkansas Racing Commission and by Legends Resort and Casino, LLC/Cherokee Nation Businesses, LLC, which was issued the casino license for Pope County by the Racing Commission on Nov. 12, 2021. The casino license was awarded after the Racing Commission nullified a license it had previously awarded to Gulfside Casino Partnership. On Dec. 7, 2021, John "Cliff" Goodin of Pope County challenged the license issue on the grounds that the Racing Commission unconstitutionally issued the license despite Legends not being a qualified applicant under Amendment 100, which authorized casino gaming in Arkansas, and that it violated the Arkansas Constitution for the commission to award the license to the "non-applicant entity" Cherokee Nation Businesses LLC/Legends Resort and Casino LLC. Legends Resort and Casino -- which was formed as an Arkansas limited liability company on Sept. 11, 2019 -- submitted an application on Jan. 15, 2020, to the Racing Commission for the license. Prior to that, the application was solely in the name of Cherokee Nation Businesses, a company wholly owned by Cherokee Nation, the largest Native American tribe in the U.S. In the dismissal motions, filed in January by Legends Resort and Casino and in April by the Racing Commission, both entities asked that Griffen dismiss Goodin's lawsuit on several grounds. The Racing Commission contended that Goodin lacks standing to sue, that the court lacks jurisdiction, that his claims are moot and that they are barred by sovereign immunity. Legends Resort and Casino, in its motion, contended that Goodin's argument over Legends' casino gaming experience was "deeply flawed" and that Goodin simply wishes to stop development of a casino in Pope County "at all costs." Legends also argued that the issue is moot because the license was issued to "the only qualified applicant" for the license. In 2018, voters in Arkansas approved Amendment 100 to the state constitution, which authorized expansion of gambling operations at racetracks in Hot Springs and West Memphis into full-fledged casinos and allowed the Racing Commission to issue one casino license each in Jefferson and Pope counties. In his ruling denying both motions, Griffen said that as a taxpayer and Pope County citizen who is affected by the state law, Goodin is entitled to challenge the constitutionality of the Racing Commission's action, and that the Racing Commission is not entitled to sovereign immunity because Goodin is only seeking injunctive relief, not monetary damages. Griffen said if it is found that the Racing Commission violated Amendment 100, "then its issuance of the casino gaming license to CNB/Legends is invalid and any rights asserted by the purported licensee are null and void."

        GRAVETTE -- The Gravette City Council, at its regular meeting Sept. 22, condemned a property within the city and approved a tract split and a rezoning. A resolution was passed condemning property at 205 Fifth Ave. N.E., owned by the Anita Barnes Atwood Trust. The structure on the property is no longer suitable for habitation, is unsafe and has been declared a nuisance. According to information presented to the council, the owner was notified of pending condemnation and did nothing to clean up the property. The council passed ordinances splitting a parcel of land at 17670 Arkansas 72 S.E. and rezoning the property from agricultural to single-family residential. The property is owned by Marion and Connie Harris. An ordinance approving a tract split for property at 12904 W. Arkansas 82 owned by Ernest J. and Karen F. Glasgow, John N. and Julie N. Butler failed for lack of a motion. This tract split had been previously denied by the Planning Commission, and the owners were appealing that decision. A resolution was passed approving a levy of 4.75 mills for real property and 4.75 mills for personal property for the year 2023. Although there will be no change in the millage, the city is required to pass a millage resolution each year. Council members voted to pay $4,500 to secure the final piece of easement for the water line relocation project on Arkansas 59 south of town. The utility relocation is to facilitate the construction of a passing lane at the intersection of Arkansas 59 and Mount Olive Road. In other business, council members voted to change the October Committee of the Whole and council meeting dates from the second and fourth Thursdays to the first and third Thursdays of the month. Mayor Kurt Maddox gave a brief bond update in the absence of Finance Director Carl Rabey and said all of the sidewalk funds have been spent. Kansas City Southern should start work soon on the Dallas Street crossing, which will be a part of the walking trail system. Council member Richard Carver asked about possible sources of revenue to help with funding needed traffic lights in the city, and Maddox reported he had sent an email to the state highway commission asking it to help with such funding. The only other alternative, he said, is to urge state legislators to change the laws so small cities are not responsible for paying for traffic lights on state highways. Maddox also commended council member Larry Weihe and thanked him and other organizers for a great job on the Sept. 17 Hiwasse Fall Festival.  Print Headline: Gravette council condemns property

         SILOAM SPRINGS -- Main Street Siloam Springs' annual Homegrown Festival returns from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday in downtown Siloam Springs. The Homegrown Festival is an event that showcases locally handmade goods, vintage items, food trucks and live music, according to Abby Trinidad, events and marketing coordinator for Main Street Siloam Springs. Vendors offer an array of original one-of-a-kind items including illustrations, print-making, jewelry and accessories, candles, soaps and hand-carved pieces, Trinidad said. "One thing I like about the setup of our festival is we purposely place our vendors on the street facing our brick-and-mortar stores so we can promote shopping and dining at our downtown small businesses," Trinidad said. In the past, the Homegrown Festival had about 50 vendors, Trinidad said. This year there are more than 70 vendors who will be at the festival, Trinidad said. Along with vendors, several nonprofit organizations will set up tents at the Homegrown Festival. The vendors include Ability Tree, Big Brothers Big Sisters NWA, Crystal Bridges, FBC Siloam Springs, NWA Gem and Mineral Society, Ozark Guidance-Arisa Health and Sager Classical Academy. "Most will have free activities for kids," Trinidad said. "We [also] have several farmers market vendors attending." Food trucks for the event will include Deep South BBQ, Lucy's Grilled Cheese, Frosty Bites Shaved Ice, V&A's Tasty Treats and Jaraves Tapatios, which is specialty shaved ice, Trinidad said. Live entertainment will also be on hand for the attendees of the Homegrown Festival, Trinidad said. There will be four duo groups who will perform at a stage set up by Phat Tire Bicycle Shop, Trinidad said. At 9 a.m. Route 358 will take the stage. They will be followed by Common Roots at 11 a.m., Young and Gray at 1 p.m. and Maud Crawford at 3 p.m. "We chose to have them at Phat Tire to keep everything central," Trinidad said.

         SILOAM SPRINGS -- John Brown University dedicated its new Schmieding Foundation Commuter Student Lounge on Sept. 22. The lounge, designed for students who commute to and from campus everyday, has been on the university's agenda for years now, as the commuter population continues to grow. The dedication ceremony was headlined by JBU's Coordinator of Student Success Rob Rostoni. "I coordinate student success and commuter life, and it'll be interesting to tell you that a third of our students here are commuters," Rostoni said. "We have 405 commuters; that's the equivalent of two residence halls." He continued, saying, "This lounge is a home base. We have over 45 students in this space everyday, maybe even more than that. It is well-used. It's just really been a blessing." The new space was funded in part by the Schmieding Foundation. "The Schmieding Foundation actually invests in caring, health and education surrounding our aging community in the region. As a result of that investment, they also invest in higher education, human services, health and faith organizations," Rostoni said. Rostoni noted that the foundation has multiple investments at JBU beyond the commuter lounge. "It's fitting that Mr. Schmieding's overarching thought was, 'Where there's home, there's hope.' I think that's a good sentiment for this place; that our commuters can have a sense of home and a sense of hope for their time here at JBU," Rostoni said. Yamilet Lopez, an alumni who graduated in May with a biology degree, also spoke at the event. During her time at JBU, she served as the coordinator for commuter life. "During our first year working together, Rob and I quickly realized that the lounge that we had at the time just wasn't meeting the needs of our students, so we jumped into action and started looking for a different space," Lopez said. She continued, saying, "I really feel that this will not only have a positive impact on students academically, but also on the way they view themselves as a part of the JBU community." Rostoni commented on the necessity of the space, saying, "To our commuters, this is sometimes the only sustainable way to be at JBU. The fact that we are coming alongside and supporting them in this way and helping them in their belonging is wonderful. This commuter lounge is working toward a larger commuter life initiative. We want to cultivate the commuter voice." Rostoni and Lopez were joined in speaking by Maribel Santillan, the current coordinator for commuter life; Steve Beers, vice president of student development; and Jim Krall, vice president of university advancement.

         BELLA VISTA -- A successful 2022 season is winding down for the Bella Vista Farmers Market, with only five more Sundays remaining for shoppers to see the variety of products offered by the vendors who sell their wares each week at Village Center on Lancashire Boulevard. The final day for the farmers market is Oct. 30, and farmers market coordinator Samantha Mosher said plans are for the market to close its 2022 run with a bang. "We love to end around Halloween because we're all very festive and we love to see the kids in their costumes and get the families to come out," she said. "We'll have one big trick-or-treat for the kids. We love to see their costumes and have them come out. We'll probably have some live music that day as well and lots of kid-friendly activities so we can get the families out. We do a little 'booth-or-treat,' so every time the kids go to a booth they can get a little treat. We try to have face painters and things like that to make it a really good time for the families. But that will be our last one for the season until next March or April." Mosher said even though attendance has slowed somewhat since the start of the school year, this season has been a successful one for the farmers market with a consistent -- and large -- group of vendors selling a variety of products. "It's been slow the last few weeks, but we normally attribute that to the kids getting back into school and families getting back into that routine of school life," she said. "But, other than that, we've had a really spectacular summer. We're on par with our sales to where we were when we left Allen's, so we're doing really well. I'm very pleased." She added, "We did lose one vendor, but it was for medical issues." That, she said, is a "huge change of pace from past years when we would usually lose a quarter and maybe gain 10% of that back, but this year we've hardly lost anybody and we've gained quite a few. So it's been great." Mosher attributes part of this season's success to the fact many of the vendors are part of other markets and have helped spread the word about Bella Vista's market while set up at the other markets. "Word of mouth has been big for us because we're one of the smaller ones here in Northwest Arkansas," she said. "But word is getting out. Some of the vendors we share with the Bentonville market and their Thursday market, and they're encouraging sales out here on Sundays, and that's been really helpful." Setting up as a "Sunday only" market has helped spur the market's success, giving shoppers an option that complements the Saturday markets and the vendors another day to sell their products. "We've always done that the six or seven years we've been open, and we've never regretted it," Mosher said. "We've thrived on Sundays. Bella Vista has shown up on Sundays and been very supportive. That was probably one of the best decisions we've made." Mosher, who took over as coordinator a year after the market opened in 2016, said shoppers who attend Sunday morning church services work their visits to the market around their worship times. "We've always done Sundays," she said. "When I came I altered the times a bit, making it earlier in the day, but that was causing some issues with morning churches so that's kind of why we picked the 9 a.m.-2 p.m. slot, and it's been great." She continued, "We get a pretty good group of people that maybe go to later services, like the 10 o'clock or 11 o'clock services, and they'll stop in before they go to church, and then we get a really good crowd when the classic church services get out. People will come here on their way to brunch or grandma's for dinner, wherever they eat on Sundays." Now that fall has arrived, many of the vendors have transitioned their products to go with the new season. "A lot of our vendors kind of evolve their products as the seasons go on," Mosher said. "Right now you're going to get all your really good fall harvest vegetables -- squashes, pumpkins, potatoes, things that are really good in soups and in crock pots -- and our candle vendors will have their fall candles out. And we've got one that now has fall-flavored jams and jellies, relishes and salsas." And a new vendor has arrived with products that could enhance those jams and jellies. "We have a new vendor that just started this week, and they're selling several different varieties of sourdough bread," Mosher said. "They just started this week and are going to finish out the market with us." And even though the market is gearing up to a day-before-Halloween finish, Mosher said it's never too late to start thinking about gifts to fill out shopping lists for another upcoming holiday. "Nobody wants to hear this, but now is a good time to start your Christmas shopping," she said, "and our vendors have a lot of great Christmas gift items here. Now is a good time to come out." For those who can't make it to the market or don't have their Christmas lists ready to fill just yet, Mosher reminds everyone that most of the vendors now make their merchandise available for online shopping. "A lot of our vendors do have cards and do online shopping and make customized items, so even if you want to just come out and look around and see what we've got, you can always order off of our vendors' websites offseason," she said. "That's always a plus."  Print Headline: Bella Vista Farmers Market preparing for final month

         Arkansas is to receive almost $9.4 million in federal funding through the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the U.S. Department of Education has announced. Labeled The Stronger Connections grants, the nearly $1 billion in overall funding to the states and U.S. territories is to help schools provide all students with safe and supportive learning opportunities and environments. State education agencies are to distribute the money on a competitive basis to high-need school systems -- as determined by the state -- to fund activities as permitted by the federal Elementary and Secondary Schools Act. The money for Arkansas comes at a time when the Arkansas School Safety Commission, created by Gov. Asa Hutchinson in 2018 and reconvened earlier this year, has just completed an update of a wide-ranging set of recommendations on safety measures for schools. The recommendations deal with matters such as safety features of school buildings, campus security personnel, mental health, cyber security, and student data analysis. Hutchinson has said he hopes school districts will use the updated recommendations in their financial planning. Arkansas lawmakers approved a $50 million grant program during a special session in August to be used to address recommendations made by the safety commission. Kimberly Mundell, a spokesperson for the Arkansas Division of Elementary and Secondary Education, acknowledged the newly announced federal grant. "We are in the process of understanding the federal guidelines and requirements around the funding," Mundell said Thursday. "School safety continues to be a topic of interest and concern, and we are excited for the potential opportunities this grant may provide for districts." U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona said this week that "safe and supportive schools help our children and youth overcome challenges and provide a strong foundation for school safety. These grants will provide real benefits to real students in real schools." Evidence shows that safe and supportive schools contribute to improved academic achievement, emotional well-being, reduced disciplinary actions and increased positive behaviors, Cardona also said. Additionally the federal money can be used to support school and community partnerships aimed at preventing and responding to acts of bullying, violence and hate. Cardona sent chief state school officers a "Dear Colleague Letter" outlining principles that states are encouraged to consider when designing a competitive grant program and providing school districts with directions for how they use the funds. He recommended that the grants be awarded for: Comprehensive, evidence-based strategies that meet student social, emotional, and mental well-being needs. Plans that engage students, families, educators, staff, and community organizations in creating safe, inclusive, and supportive learning environments. Policies and practices that are responsive to underserved students, protect student rights, and demonstrate respect for student dignity and potential. The federal agency highlighted school safety initiatives in different parts of the country including in St. Paul, Minn., in 20 West Virginia school districts and in New Mexico. In St. Paul, for example, the district is using almost $13 million in federal American Rescue Plan money to support the mental health and wellness of students and staff by hiring 32 additional counselors, social workers, and psychologists; partnering with community organizations to offer mental health support for students; training staff on how to handle trauma; and creating calming spaces for staff and students. School districts in West Virginia are implementing evidence-based community schools and adding counselors. Six counties now employ at least one health professional in each school, and nearly 100 schools have expanded mental health services, according to the federal agency.

         FAYETTEVILLE -- Two men pleaded innocent in Washington County Circuit Court on Wednesday to attempted capital murder and committing a terroristic act, related to a shooting incident in Springdale last month. Jamie Castro-Trujillo and Michael Adief Figueroa, both 18 and of Springdale, were given Jan. 5 court dates before Circuit Judge Mark Lindsay. Springdale police responded to a call about a shooting around 1:30 a.m. Aug. 13 in the area of George Park but did not locate a victim or suspect. Officers found 12 spent shell casings just south of the park on Hylton Road and were advised a nearby residence on Butterfly Avenue had been struck, though no injuries to anyone inside the residence were reported, according to a Police Department news release. About 5:30 a.m., police received a call from a local hospital saying it was treating a 15-year-old male with a gunshot wound to his knee. The boy identified two men, Castro-Trujillo and Figueroa, as suspects in the incident, according to a police report. The boy told police he'd agreed to meet Castro-Trujillo at the park for a fight; as he drove up, he saw a red car parked just south of the park, then heard gunshots hitting his pickup, according to the report. The boy sped away, but he had been struck once in the right knee with a bullet, the report states. Figueroa admitted during an interview with detectives to shooting a Glock pistol at a pickup, according to the report.  Print Headline: 2 Springdale men plead innocent in August shooting

         Armed burglary ends in arrest Jacksonville police arrested a man after an armed burglary late Wednesday, according to an arrest report. One of at least three victims told officers arriving at the First Street residence just before 9:30 p.m. that Ivan Crawford, 32, of Jacksonville, had entered the home with a revolver and had threatened the victims, who left the area to get to safety. A victim returned to the scene, where Crawford began headbutting him and tried to force the victim to drive Crawford to where one of the other victims had fled to. Officers set up a perimeter around the house and Crawford eventually complied with police commands, with officers taking a .22 caliber revolver from his waistband. Crawford is charged with aggravated residential burglary and first-degree terroristic threatening, both felonies, and misdemeanor counts of third-degree battery and theft of property. Man caught with stolen U-Haul truck Little Rock police arrested a man early Thursday who had drugs and a gun and was driving a stolen U-Haul truck, according to an arrest report. Richard Tomboli, 56, of Sherwood, was driving a U-Haul box truck that had been reported stolen out of Sherwood when officers pulled him over near 700 E. Roosevelt Road around 12:30 a.m. Police searched the vehicle and located a Browning 9mm pistol, a baggie of white powder, prescription drugs, and a glass pipe, the report states. Tomboli is a felon and cannot legally own a gun. He is charged with simultaneous possession of drugs and a gun, possession of a firearm by a certain person, theft by receiving, possession of drug paraphernalia and three drug possession counts. All are felony charges.  Print Headline: Armed burglary ends in arrest Man arrested with stolen U-Haul truck

         100 years ago Sept. 30, 1922 WALNUT RIDGE -- A well known lawyer from Sharp county attending Chancery Court at Powhatan yesterday, walked up to a stranger and confided that he was very thirsty and, being unfamiliar with "the ropes," would appreciate it if the stranger could give him information as to where good "white mule" could be found. The stranger admitted politely that he had no such data and expressed his regret at his inability to be of service. The lawyer then introduced himself, and the stranger said he was John O. Long, sheriff. The lawyer then said: "Well, I didn't intend to embarrass you, and I didn't suppose you were an officer, but a stranger has to ask questions to find out about local conditions." The sheriff says the lawyer transacted his business and left town, still thirsty. 50 years ago Sept. 30, 1972 HOT SPRINGS -- The operator and a waitress at the Whispering Winds tavern at Hot Springs have been charged with keeping a gambling house in indictments returned by the Garland County Grand Jury. Authorities Thursday disclosed the indictments against Harry Roberts and Clara Gobert. They were released on $5,000 bond. 25 years ago Sept. 30, 1997 A lawyer contacted by FBI agents investigating bomb scares at two Little Rock abortion clinics remained mum publicly Monday about his actions last week. J. Fred Hart spoke briefly to a reporter outside his home Monday evening but would only say that his opposition to abortion is well known. ... Employees at Little Rock Family Planning Services and the Women's Community Health Center called police Thursday after arriving at work to find yellow Ryder rental trucks parked outside the clinics. Police evacuated nearby buildings after a bomb-sniffing dog detected possible explosives inside the trucks. No explosives were found. The trucks resembled the yellow Ryder rental truck used in the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing that killed 168 people. Charles V. Suphan, Hart's law partner, said Friday that Little Rock police and the FBI wanted to talk to Hart because the trucks had been rented in Hart's name. ... A federal law called the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) prohibits the use of "force or the threat of force" to "interfere" with or "intimidate" anyone seeking reproductive health services. ... The trucks appeared to partially block driveways to the clinics, but the doors remained unobstructed. Little Rock police have said they don't know whether any state laws were broken. 10 years ago Sept. 30, 2012 It's interesting to note where former prisoner Damien Echols has chosen to settle following his 2011 release. Echols, Jessie Misskelley Jr. and Jason Baldwin were convicted as teens for the 1993 murders of three 8-year-old West Memphis boys, Stevie Branch, Christopher Byers and Michael Moore. During the 1994 trial, the prosecution asserted that the younger boys were killed as part of a satanic ritual. After 18 years behind bars, Echols, Misskelley and Baldwin were released in a rare deal in which they entered guilty pleas but maintained their innocence. So what city have Echols and wife Lorri Davis recently decided to call home? Salem, Mass., according to a recent New York Times feature on Echols. ... Echols describes Salem as "the only place on earth where I'm in the majority."  Print Headline: Other days

         One man died and two more people, one of them a child, were injured in a head-on collision on Arkansas 18 near Jonesboro on Sunday evening, according to a preliminary fatality report from Jonesboro police. Grant Dreiling, 22, of Jonesboro was turning from a private drive onto Arkansas 18 at 7:45 p.m. when his vehicle traveled into the opposite lane, where it was struck by another vehicle head-on, fatally injuring him. The driver of the second vehicle, 28-year-old Guillermo Norterto, of Jonesboro, was also hurt in the crash, as was an unnamed minor in his vehicle. An officer investigating the wreck reported that the weather was clear and the road was dry at the time.  Print Headline: Head-on crash kills Jonesboro man, 22

        A Lonoke County man is facing a sentence of 15 to 40 years in prison after pleading guilty before a federal judge Thursday to one count of transportation of child pornography. Tommy Campbell, 59, of Lonoke, pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge Brian Miller to the single count of transportation of child pornography in exchange for the dismissal of one count of possession of child pornography contained in an indictment handed up by a federal grand jury in Little Rock on Oct. 12, 2019. Campbell was initially charged in a criminal complaint filed the previous month by Amber Kalmer -- a detective with the Little Rock Police Department assigned as an FBI task force officer investigating crimes against children -- with receipt/distribution of child pornography, possession of child pornography with intent to view and transportation of child pornography. According to court records, Campbell, a registered sex offender, has two previous convictions involving children. In 1991, records said, he was convicted of a charge of indecent act with a child and in 1998, he was convicted on a charge of indecency with a minor-exposure. Court records said that offense involved engaging in sexual contact with a 7-year-old girl. Assistant U.S. Attorney Kristin Bryant, going over the terms of Campbell's plea agreement, said in addition to the prison term, Campbell's guilty plea also exposes him to a term of supervised release ranging from five years to life, as well as a $250,000 fine and a possible special assessment of $5,000 under terms of the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015. "If it is determined the defendant does not have a prior conviction," Bryant said, "the maximum penalty is not less than five years imprisonment to not more than 20 years." Bryant said a number of stipulations were also included with the plea agreement. "Specifically, the parties agree that the base offense level is 22," she said. "The defendant shall receive an additional two levels because the offense involved a prepubescent who had not attained the age of 12, an additional four levels because the offense involved sadistic or masochistic conduct, an additional two levels because the offense involved at least 10 but less than 150 images." Bryant said without the plea agreement, Campbell could have received an additional two level increase because the offense involved the use of a computer. She said Campbell is eligible for a two level decrease to the offense level for acceptance of responsibility in pleading guilty. "A determination of a third level decrease will be made at time of sentencing," she said. Under questioning from Miller, Campbell confirmed that the terms of a plea agreement were accurate and said he wished to move forward with a guilty plea. Earlier, after explaining Campbell's trial rights and appeal rights he would be surrendering by pleading guilty, Miller explained that before he could calculate a sentence for him, the U.S. Probation Office would have to complete a pretrial report that would enable Miller to calculate an appropriate sentence under U.S. sentencing guidelines. But, he said, that calculation would come with a caveat. "In the federal system we have our law that tells me what the minimum and maximum sentences are that I can give you," Miller said. "In addition to the law we have sentencing guidelines to help me determine what an appropriate sentence is. I'm not required to give you a sentence in the range provided by the guidelines as long as I give you a sentence in the range that is provided by the law." Miller explained that, until the pre-sentence report is completed and approved, there would be no way to accurately predict what a guideline sentence range might be. "They'll look in to all of your history," he explained. "Your work history, your drug and alcohol history, your educational background, your family history and your criminal history. Then, probation will calculate your guideline range but we don't have that here today so we can't tell you what your guideline range is going to be and therefore we can't tell you what your sentence is going to be." Miller told Campbell when he returns for sentencing that should he receive a longer sentence than expected, he would not be allowed to withdraw his guilty plea and that because parole has been abolished in the federal prison system, whatever sentence he receives will be the sentence he will serve." "You may get good time but you won't get parole," he said. Outlining the factual basis for Campbell's plea, Bryant said that on July 24, 2019, Kalmer received a copy of a CyberTipline report regarding activity on a Google account registered to Campbell. "The CyberTip contained three image files that were uploaded and stored in the Google photos infrastructure," Bryant said. "The images were uploaded on June 17, 2019." Information provided indicated that the IP addresses associated with the photos, which Bryant said were determined to fit the statutory definition of child pornography, were linked to Campbell's gmail account. Bryant said that when a search warrant was executed on Campbell's Lonoke home, Campbell's cellphone was searched and found to contain numerous images of child pornography in addition to those that had been discovered uploaded to his Google account. "A review of Tommy Campbell's criminal history reveals that he is a registered sex offender," Bryant concluded. "Did you listen to the statement given by the U.S. attorney?" Miller asked Campbell. "Was her statement accurate?" "Yes sir," Campbell replied, to both questions. "How do you plead to Count 1 of the October 2, 2019, indictment?" "Guilty, sir." "Did you, in fact, commit the offense as charged?" Miller asked. "Yes sir, I did," Campbell answered. After dismissing the remaining charge in the indictment, Miller told Campbell that once the pre-sentence report is completed, he should review it with his attorney, Marjorie Rogers of Little Rock, in order to ensure the accuracy of the report. "This is important," Miller admonished, "because the sentence I give you will be based on the pre-sentence report. That's how I determine what the appropriate sentence is for you so you have to make sure it's correct."  Print Headline: Man pleads guilty to child porn

         FORT SMITH -- The Sebastian County Election Commission got a new member ahead of the Nov. 8 general election, replacing one whose legal trouble forced him off the commission earlier this month. Randy McFadden, 63, of Greenwood was sworn in to the commission as a Republican on Sept. 16, according to the county clerk's office. He replaced Jason Vineyard, whom Sebastian County's Republican Committee removed as commission chairman Sept. 12, the same day the clerk's office canceled Vineyard's voter registration because of an outstanding felony conviction. Larry Bishop, committee chairman, said Thursday the committee selected McFadden on Sept. 15. He was one of four candidates from Sebastian County the committee considered and was deemed to have both the desire to be an election commissioner and the time needed to carry out job duties. "There's no certain background or anything anyone has to have, so it comes down to basically if they desire to do the work and they're willing to make the commitment and have the time available to fulfill the commitment," Bishop said. McFadden described his new role as "exciting." He said he always wondered how the election process worked as a voter and will now actually help carry it out. The Election Commission's task is to ensure all staff members involved in the general election do their jobs correctly so the public has confidence in the system, he said. "There's so much out there right now in the news, so much unknown, that I just want people to know that I'm going to be in there and I'm a hands-on person," McFadden said. McFadden said he retired as a security manager with UPS in 2014. He has also worked for the Springdale Police Department and served as a reserve officer for the Washington and Sebastian County sheriff's offices. He ran for the Sebastian County sheriff position in 2018. A person has to be a qualified elector of Arkansas to serve on an election commission, according to the 2020 edition of the County Board of Election Commissioners Procedures Manual prepared by the Arkansas State Board of Election Commissioners. A qualified elector can't have been convicted of a felony without their sentence having been discharged or pardoned under the Arkansas Constitution. County Prosecuting Attorney Dan Shue wrote in a letter to County Clerk Sharon Brooks on Sept. 12 that Vineyard pleaded guilty to one count of felony overdraft in 2003. The county Circuit Court suspended the imposition of Vineyard's sentence for 10 years with the condition of good behavior and that Vineyard pay $20,055 in restitution, along with a $500 fine and $150 in court costs. Vineyard, 43, still hadn't fully paid those costs, meaning he hadn't discharged his sentence, according to Shue. Vineyard also hadn't been pardoned. Sebastian County's Republican Committee appointed Vineyard to the Election Commission after fellow Republican David Damron's resignation from the commission chairman position in January.

         MONTICELLO -- What was promoted as a ribbon cutting for the new Arkansas Center for Forest Business was actually a log breaking outside the University of Arkansas at Monticello's Chamberlin Forest Resource complex. Gov. Asa Hutchinson broke off an end of a round log that revealed a large sticker for the new center during a dedication ceremony Thursday morning. The center is part of UAM's College of Forestry, Agriculture and Natural Resources -- the only forestry school in the state -- and was created by the state legislature last year, with $841,000 in state funding going toward the center July 1. "The governor and the state legislature have provided us funding, so we will be hiring additional people -- technical experts in forest business to promote the growth of the forest industry in the state of Arkansas, and do it in a sustainable manner," said Matthew Pelkki, UAM's forestry chair. "The beauty of it is, we have so many forestry scientists here, we can tap into all that expertise here. This is a great location to have that business center." Forestry is growing as an industry in Arkansas, according to Hutchinson and UAM officials. The governor said forests cover 56% of Arkansas' territory, and the industry accounts for $6 billion directly to its economy, which is largely dependent on timber. Forests in the state are also growing twice as fast as harvested, he added. "That, to me, is an astounding fact but also a reassuring fact for those that value our forests as I do," Hutchinson said. "[There are] 18.4 million acres of forests that scrub our air, shelter our wildlife and enhance our lakes and streams, and that truly makes us the Natural State. But this Center for Forest Business will do more than simply allow us to preserve our forests and enjoy them forever. It will create jobs. It will increase incomes and it will strengthen communities in southeast Arkansas. That has to be an objective of all of ours. At the same time, [it's] managing the forests in a way that keeps them vibrant, keeps them healthy and part of our future." Efforts to promote forestry in Arkansas, Hutchinson said, have included recruiting mills and forestry product companies to come to the state. "Forestry's contribution to the economy is a contribution to the quality of life in Arkansas to have healthy forests," said Michael Blazier, dean of the College of Agriculture, Forestry and Natural Resources. "When you look at the contribution of forestry to the Arkansas economy as a proportion of its gross domestic product, Arkansas' third in the country in terms of the total amount of contribution forestry provides to the economy and the Southeast U.S. The Southeast U.S. is one of the primary producers of timber products in the world. It produces 20% of the world's sawtimber, pulpwood and forest products, and it's Arkansas that's part of the breadbasket of that breadbasket, because we're not seeing the larger losses of forestland to urban development that we see in other parts of the Southeast like the Carolinas and Georgia, so the Natural State is staying kind of the Natural State." Arkansas has also added enough new forests to fill Delaware within the last 20 years, Blazier commented. The forestry complex at UAM was remodeled in 2012 and added computer labs and classrooms to meet a growing student population, Pelkki said. The building also houses a U.S. Forest Service Research Center, as well as forestry and agriculture students. Graduate placement in jobs is about 100% within six months of their commencement, and recruitment of new forestry students to UAM is going "very well," Pelkki added. Hutchinson touted the importance of research and development done at UAM and in collaboration with the main University of Arkansas campus in Fayetteville. "The center here of UAM involves all of those, the recruitment part that we rely upon you to bring businesses here, the expansion of timber and construction and the development area combined with our work at Fayetteville. UAM is a leader in all three," Hutchinson said. "It's exciting to see the young people it will impact over the next decades, as well as the way it will strengthen Arkansas, our economy and our communities in south Arkansas."

        The number of Arkansans hospitalized with covid-19 fell Thursday to its lowest level in three months. However, the state's death toll from the virus, as tracked by the Arkansas Department of Health, rose by 17, to 12,148. The number of covid-19 patients in the state's hospitals fell Thursday by 19, to 231. It was the smallest number since June 28, and the second consecutive day of double-digit drops.  The state's count of coronavirus cases rose by 343. That was smaller by 156 than the increase on Wednesday, and less than half the size of the number of new cases reported the previous Thursday. It was the smallest daily increase in cases on a Thursday since May 12. Declining for the 16th straight day, the average daily increase in the state's covid case count over a rolling seven-day period fell to 363. It was the first time the rolling seven-day daily average had been below 400 since the week ending June 3. The number of cases in the state that were considered active fell by 303, to 5,137, as recoveries outpaced new cases. The count of active cases was already at its lowest level since June 7. After rising the previous two days, the number of the state's virus patients who were in intensive care remained Thursday at 47. Growing for the second day in a row, the number of those patients on ventilators rose by four, to 17. Since the pandemic reached Arkansas in March 2020, the state Health Department has reported 951,283 cases of coronavirus. Of those, 933,750 are considered recovered.

        The fiancee of the man shot to death in a Sherwood hospital on Wednesday told police that the gunman "asked how long they had been together," according to an arrest report from the Sherwood Police Department. Jade Pye was a patient on the fourth floor of CHI St. Vincent Hospital North in Sherwood on Wednesday. She told police that Leighton Whitfield, 21, of North Little Rock was visiting her when “Ajay” — also known as Raymond Lovett, 24, of Little Rock — arrived in the hospital room. Pye told police that Lovett “asked how long they had been together," and then he shot Whitfield. Lovett then pointed the gun at Pye until she pressed the emergency button on the hospital bed; he then left the room, the report states. Sherwood Police Chief Jeff Hagar said in a Wednesday afternoon press conference that Lovett and Whitfield knew each other, and the shooting appeared to be an isolated event. Police responded to the report of shots fired at CHI St. Vincent just before 10 a.m. Wednesday, and then placed the hospital on lockdown to secure and clear the facility with the help of other agencies, according to the Sherwood Police Department. Officers said they found Whitfield dead from at least one gunshot wound. Little Rock police were alerted that a “potential suspect” in the shooting was at Zimmermans Exxon, 5223 S. University Ave., around 11 a.m. Wednesday. The gas station is located about 14 miles south of CHI St. Vincent in Sherwood. Lovett has been charged with capital murder and aggravated assault. According to court documents, Lovett pleaded innocent to both charges Thursday morning. Judge Milas Hale issued a no contact order in favor of the "victim and their address." The order is set to remain in effect for one year unless the court modifies it. Lovett's next court date is expected to be in November. An online inmate roster indicates that Lovett remained in the Pulaski County jail as of Thursday afternoon in lieu of a $500,000 bond.

         FAYETTEVILLE -- A homeless man was arrested Monday after he reportedly threatened to burn down St. James Baptist Church. Dillon McDonald, 27, of Fayetteville, was arrested in connection with terroristic threatening, criminal trespass, open burning, public intoxication and possession of a controlled substance. He was being held Thursday in the Washington County Detention Center on $10,000 bond. According to a police report, a caller said a man, later identified as McDonald, had approached her and asked if she knew "this" (St. James) was a Black church. The caller said the man, who was shirtless and wearing one yellow glove, said he was going to burn "this sucker down" and approached the church with a blanket filled with smoldering mulch and small shrubs. Police said an officer arrived on the scene and found a smoldering pile of debris in the parking lot north of the church. The officer said he saw a man, later identified as McDonald, climbing onto the roof of the nearby Circle K store. McDonald told police he was on the roof to bundle the cable. According to the report, McDonald admitted to setting the items in the parking lot on fire and then said the fire had already started, and he dragged the material away from the building. The blanket and the material set on fire was taken from the U-Haul business just north of the church, police said. McDonald was arrested and officers found a shirt and one yellow glove on the roof of the Circle K store. A matching yellow glove was found in the pile of burning material. According to the report, officers also found a plastic bag containing psilocybin mushrooms on the roof.  Print Headline: Homeless man arrested after threatening to burn church

         FAYETTEVILLE -- A man who police say shot at three people in a car inside a Dickson Street parking garage last summer pleaded guilty Monday to committing a terroristic act and other charges. Travean Billups, 23, of 66 W. Rainsong St. in Farmington, was sentenced by Washington County Circuit Judge Mark Lindsay to a total of 30 years at the Arkansas Department of Corrections after pleading guilty to terroristic threatening, first-degree battery, robbery, committing a terroristic act, failure to appear, aggravated assault on a household or family member, endangering the welfare of a minor and carrying a weapon. Billups was given credit for jail time served back to June 24, 2021. Fayetteville police were sent to the parking garage at 609 W. Dickson St. on June 13, 2021 after reports of shots being fired, according to a preliminary report. Officers found several spent shell casings and signs of bullet impacts on a wall inside the garage. Video surveillance showed several vehicles and people had entered the garage and were involved in a fight. Two men entered the garage and ran to where the fight was occurring, according to the report. One of the men was holding a black handgun and wearing a light blue hat turned to the side. Police said the people who had been fighting were trying to leave in their vehicles when the man with the handgun began shooting. Three shots hit one of the vehicles. The driver continued out of the garage and later contacted the police. The driver identified Billups as the man who had shot at her vehicle, according to the report. She said the shooting resulted from prior arguments. Billups also was arrested June 16, 2020, in connection with attempted capital murder and aggravated robbery, according to documents filed in Washington County Circuit Court and Washington County Detention Center records. The attempted murder charge was dropped as part of Billups' plea bargain. Police said at the time Billups had been involved in a drug deal that ended when he shot a man who had made arrangements to buy drugs from him. Billups was released June 26, 2020, on $100,000 bond on the attempted capital murder and aggravated robbery charges, but failed to appear for a court date in July, 2020. Billups was subsequently arrested and jailed on $1 million bond while awaiting trial.  Print Headline: Billups sentenced to 30 years in prison

        Arkansas and five other states are suing the Biden Administration over its plan to cancel some debt for those who took out loans to attend college, Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge announced Thursday. The lawsuit, filed Thursday in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri, alleges President Joe Biden violated federal law and exceeded his constitutional authority by issuing an executive order to cancel student debt for some borrowers. “President Bidens unlawful political play puts the self-wrought college-loan debt on the backs of millions of hardworking Americans who are struggling to pay their utility bills and home loans in the midst of Bidens inflation,” Rutledge said in a statement. “President Biden does not have the power to arbitrarily erase the college debt of adults who chose to take out those loans.” In August, Biden announced a plan to cancel student loan debt that could provide relief for more than 125,000 Arkansans. Under the proposal, borrowers could have up to $10,000 of their student loan debt forgiven. If the borrower qualified for Pell grants the amount of debt that could be canceled could be as much as $20,000. Bidens student loan debt cancellation is only open to individuals making less than $125,000 a year or $250,000 a year for households. Bidens announcement drew unified criticism from Republican lawmakers in Congress who said Biden did not have the power to issue an executive order to cancel student loan debt. Biden said economic challenges from the covid-19 pandemic created a need to provide relief for those with student loan debt. Arkansas joins Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska and South Carolina in the lawsuit against the Biden administration.

        FAYETTEVILLE -- Two men pleaded not guilty in Washington County Circuit Court on Wednesday to attempted capital murder and committing a terroristic act, related to a shooting incident in Springdale last month. Jamie Castro-Trujillo and Michael Adief Figueroa, both 18 of Springdale were given Jan. 5 court dates before Circuit Judge Mark Lindsay. Springdale police responded to a call about a shooting around 1:30 a.m. Aug. 13 in the area of George Park, but did not locate a victim or suspect. Officers found 12 spent shell casings just south of the park on Hylton Road and were advised a nearby residence on Butterfly Avenue had been struck, although no injuries to anyone inside the residence were reported, according to a Police Department news release. About 5:30 a.m., police received a call from a local hospital saying it was treating a 15-year-old male with a gunshot wound to his knee. The boy identified two men, Castro-Trujillo and Figueroa, as suspects in the incident, according to a police report. The boy told police he'd agreed to meet Castro-Trujillo at the park for a physical fight; as he drove up, he saw a red car parked just south of the park, then heard gunshots hitting his pickup, according to the report. The boy sped away, but he had been struck once in the right knee with a bullet, the report states. Figueroa admitted during an interview with detectives to shooting a Glock pistol at a pickup, according to the report.  Print Headline: Two arraigned in Springdale Shooting

         FAYETTEVILLE -- Police say they arrested a local man Wednesday night after he pointed a gun and threatened another man in the parking lot of a College Avenue restaurant. Harris Freeman, 20, of 4123 N. Cadillac Drive, No. 2, in Fayetteville, was arrested in connection with aggravated assault. Freeman was taken to the Washington County Detention Center, according to a preliminary report from the Fayetteville Police Department. Officers were sent to the Black Bear Diner at 4078 N. College Ave. around 7:15 p.m. Wednesday after receiving several calls reporting an armed person. According to the report, several callers said a white man was holding a black man at gunpoint in the parking lot. When officers arrived they spoke with the victim, who said he had been trying to back into a parking space when another car came around a corner and met his vehicle head-on. The man, whose name police did not release, told officers the driver of the second vehicle, later identified as Freeman, stopped in the parking lot. The man said he asked Freeman "what the problem was" and saw Freeman looking for something in his vehicle. Freeman retrieved a firearm from his vehicle and pointed it at the victim. Freeman got out of his vehicle and continued pointing the gun at the man, according to the report. The man said he yelled at Freeman but never displayed a firearm during the incident. The man said Freeman continued to point the weapon at him until he got back into his car and drove away. Witnesses inside the restaurant provided police video of the incident and a license plate number for a black Honda Civic. The car was registered to Freeman. Other officers saw Freeman's car enter a parking lot at 4201 N. Shiloh Drive and made a traffic stop. Freeman was taken into custody without incident and police said they found a 9 mm handgun in the front passenger seat of the Honda. Freeman told police he had honked his horn at the other man because of the way he was driving. He said he feared for his safety and that his "problem solver" was in the car so he grabbed his gun, exited his car and pointed the gun at the man, according to the report. Freeman told officers he spoke to the man, saying "Are you willing to die?" and "If you touch me I will shoot you." He said he did not call the police because he had "solved the problem," according to the report.  Print Headline: Fayetteville man arrested after parking lot threats

        An 18-year-old was arrested Monday in connection with the Sept. 18 shooting at a Conway shopping mall, police said. NasJuan East, who is from Conway, faces an attempted capital murder charge after being wanted by authorities, according to a Facebook post from Conway Police Department. Officers said they responded to the shooting at the Conway Commons shopping center, 310 Elsinger Blvd., and found a victim with multiple gunshot wounds. The victim was taken to a local area hospital for treatment and was released, according to the post. The North Little Rock and Little Rock Police Department assisted with the arrest.  An online inmate roster from the Faulker County jail indicated East remained in custody as of Thursday morning.

        Walmart Inc. opened the first of four fulfillment centers Wednesday that it says will use a patent-pending process to speed packing and shipping times for online orders. Besides the new 1 million-square-foot facility in Joliet, Ill., the company said in June that it will build three more of these "next-generation" facilities over the next three years. When they're all completed, they could provide next-day or two-day shipping to 75% of the U.S. population, the company said. Working with tech firm Knapp, Walmart developed an automated, high-density storage system that streamlines what was a 12-step process into five. Walmart tested the system at a fulfillment center in Pennsylvania and found the benefits included doubling both the center's storage capacity and the number of orders it can fulfill in a day. The fulfillment centers will move not only the millions of items on Walmart.com but also the Marketplace items shipped through Walmart Fulfillment Services.

        Senate President Pro Tempore Jimmy Hickey has given Sen. Alan Clark until late Monday afternoon to turn in his Senate license plates, keys to his Senate office and Capitol Hill apartment northeast of the state Capitol, keycards to the state Capitol and the Capitol Hill apartment, and any Senate-issued electronic devices such as a laptop and iPad. Hickey, R-Texarkana, asked Clark, R-Lonsdale, in a two-page letter dated Tuesday to turn the items and any other Senate items issued to Clark as a state senator into the state Capitol Police office by 4:30 p.m. Monday. "Understanding that you have personal items that you may want to remove from your Senate office or desk or from your Capitol Hill apartment during your suspension, you will be provided access to the Senate Chamber, your Senate office, and your Capitol Hill apartment until 4:30 p.m. on October, 3, 2022," Hickey wrote in his letter to Clark. He said Clark will be immediately prohibited from accessing his Senate email and Senate computer accounts; contacting or working with the Senate, Bureau of Legislative Research and Legislative Audit staff except during the Senate orientation and organization meetings; and accessing legislator-only areas within the state Capitol and the Big MAC (Multi-Agency Complex) building west of the Capitol, except during the Senate orientation and organization meetings. The Senate's temporary suspension of Clark is the first suspension of a state senator since the Senate adopted a code of ethics in the late 1990s, according to Senate officials. Hickey said Wednesday his letter to Clark was sent to Clark by U.S. mail and email and Clark was notified by text about the letter. Clark said Wednesday in a text to the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette that he has received Hickey's letter. He declined further comment. Hickey said in his letter that Clark's immediate loss of his seniority means that he has been moved to position 35 for the remainder of the 93rd General Assembly that ends Jan. 8, and the Senate will consider a recommendation that his loss of seniority be sustained as the first order of business during its organization session in November and that he remain at position 35 during the 94th General Assembly, which begins Jan. 9. He said Clark's suspension for the remainder of the 93rd General Assembly will end at "11:59:59 p.m." Jan. 8, and includes the loss of reimbursement for conference registration fees or travel reimbursements related to in-state or out-of-state travel, and attendance at legislative committee meetings or meetings of the Senate, except for any Senate organizational or orientation meetings of the 94th General Assembly. Hickey said his letter reflects the Senate's 26-4 vote on Tuesday to find that Clark violated the Senate's ethics rules by filing spurious, frivolous and retaliatory charges of ethics violations against Sen. Stephanie Flowers, D-Pine Bluff, and to suspend Clark and strip him of his seniority until the start of the 2023 regular session Jan. 9, and to recommend the Senate strip him of his seniority during the next two years. He read a copy of the letter to the Senate on Tuesday afternoon. The Bureau of Legislative Research released a copy of a letter Wednesday. The Senate's 26-4 vote to temporarily suspend Clark required at least 24 votes to be approved under the Senate's ethic rules, so that motion was approved with two votes to spare. The Senate's votes for finding that Clark violated the Senate's ethics rules, and to temporarily suspend him and strip him of his seniority, included votes from 18 Republican senators, seven Democratic senators and independent Sen. Jim Hendren of Sulphur Springs. These votes affirmed its eight-member Senate Ethics Committee's findings and recommendations. The Senate Ethics Committee included Republican Sens. Kim Hammer of Benton, Missy Irvin of Mountain View, Mat Pitsch of Fort Smith, Dan Sullivan of Jonesboro, and David Wallace of Leachville, and Democratic Sens. Joyce Elliott of Little Rock, Keith Ingram of West Memphis and Clark Tucker of Little Rock. Republican Sens. Bob Ballinger of Ozark, Charles Beckham of McNeil, Trent Garner of El Dorado and Mark Johnson of Ferndale dissented on all three votes. Along with Clark, Republican Sens. Ron Caldwell of Wynne, Jason Rapert of Conway, Gary Stubblefield of Branch, and James Sturch of Batesville didn't attend the Senate's meeting Tuesday. The chamber's actions Tuesday came after almost three hours of wrangling in the Senate without Clark on hand and more than two hours of debate Sept. 16 with Clark and his two attorneys on hand. On Sept. 16, the Senate voted over Clark's objection to recess and resume its deliberations at a meeting called later by Hickey. Last week, Hickey set the Senate's meeting for Tuesday. In an email dated Sept. 7, Clark advised Sens. Bart Hester, R-Cave Springs, Hammer, Hickey and three legislative staff members that, "Just to let you know that I will be out of state September 23 through October 1 for a trip planned and reservations made and paid months ago." Clark has said he paid for lodging for the out-of-state trip with family and friends and it's not refundable, and he wasn't going to ruin his family's trip. Even if he could have attended Tuesday's meeting, Clark said he wouldn't appear before the Senate without his attorneys, who he said were out of state this week. During the Senate's meeting Tuesday, Hickey said Clark authorized Garner to represent him in the Senate before the Senate voted to give Garner time to make a presentation for Clark. After Garner walked away from the Senate's podium, state Sen. Jonathan Dismang, R-Searcy, said that "I believe that this is being made a mockery of our processes and it is time to end it." Then, the Senate voted 26-4 to approve Dismang's motion for the Senate to find that Clark violated the Senate's ethics rules by filing a frivolous, spurious and retaliatory ethics complaint against Flowers. Gun range owner Jan Morgan of Hot Springs said Wednesday in a text message that "What Republicans did yesterday to Senator Clark was a political hit job. "THE PEOPLE NEED RECALL POWER FOR BAD POLITICIANS like other states," said Morgan, who has made unsuccessful bids for the Republican nomination for governor in 2018 and for the U.S. Senate earlier this year. "What some fellow Republicans did to him yesterday reminds me of the scripture 'straining on gnats while swallowing camels, ' " she said. Irvin told her fellow senators Tuesday that "I, for one, am not going to wear the Republican lens" in considering Clark's case. "That's not ethical for me," she said. "I can't put on Republican glasses and say this is a partisan issue. That would be unethical for me and below my standard as a person. I can't do that." Irvin said "I have to maintain my own personal standard of honor, and integrity, and honesty. That was not maintained by Senator Clark through this process with the Ethics Committee, which led us to where we are today." Clark has served in the Senate since 2013. He is unopposed in Senate District 7 in the Nov. 8 general election. On Sept. 16, the Senate voted 29-0 to concur with its Ethics Committee's finding that Flowers didn't violate the Senate's ethics rules with Garner abstaining. Clark and Flowers voted with 27 other senators. On Aug. 18, Clark filed an ethics complaint against Flowers alleging she violated the Senate's code of ethics by accepting legislative per diem payments for participating by Zoom in the Senate's regular session meetings in 2021. The Ethics Committee found that Flowers had not violated any provisions of the Senate's ethics rules and recommended the Senate uphold the committee's finding and not impose any penalties against Flowers because the committee found the issue at hand to be "clerical only." The committee said Flowers contacted the Senate staff as soon as she became aware in the 2021 regular session of the deposits in her bank account that she felt had been made in error, and she was assured by Senate staff that she was entitled to the payments she received. Flowers reimbursed the state Senate $2,714 on Aug. 11 and $217.60 on Aug. 22 that was erroneously paid to her during the 2021 regular session, the committee said. Hickey has said he learned from the Senate staff as a result of Clark's inquiries about legislative expense reimbursements that Garner and Flowers, who participated in the Senate's meetings through Zoom during the 2021 regular session, were each incorrectly paid per diem. In a check dated Sept. 1, Garner reimbursed the Senate $906, according to Senate records. "Zoom" was written on the check. In its report to the Senate, the Ethics Committee said "the only purpose to the filing of the [complaint] and any that he has plans to file going forward, seems to be to fulfill his promise on July 3 to 'burn the house down.'" "These frivolous and and spurious allegations only serve to create a divisive environment within the Senate and bring dishonor to the institution of the Senate." Clark said Tuesday that "Time will reveal the truth. "We all have a right to our own opinions, but not to our own facts," he said. "Close to $4,000 has been paid back to the state as a result of my investigation. More should have been. "How can we be expected to fight corruption and wrongdoing in government if we can't reveal and stand against our own questionable behavior?" "I am saddened for this body that I love, more than anything else," Clark said. "I will continue to stand for right and fight corruption shoulder to shoulder with whomever will stand with me." On June 15, Hickey filed an ethics complaint against Sen. Mark Johnson for Johnson signing Clark's name on the sign-in sheet for reimbursement at the Senate Boys State committee meeting June 3 that Clark didn't attend. Hickey also filed a complaint against Clark for asking Johnson to seek reimbursement from public funds for Clark for that meeting. The Senate didn't pay the $155 per diem to Clark for that meeting at the behest of Senate leaders. On July 21, the Senate approved the Ethics Committee's findings that Clark and Johnson violated the Senate's ethics rules as well as the committee's recommended punishments. For violating the Senate's ethics rule, the Senate's punishment for Clark on July 21 was to strip him of his committee chairman and vice chairman posts and block his eligibility for per diem and mileage reimbursement for the rest of this year. He also was reprimanded by the Senate, and any future Senate president pro tempores are not to consider Clark for appointment to serve on Boys State, Girls State or the Senate Ethics Committee. Clark had been chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, vice chairman of the Legislative Council Review Subcommittee, co-chairman of the Legislative Council Occupational Licensing Review Subcommittee, and chairman of the Child Maltreatment Investigations Oversight Committee.

        A Sherwood hospital was partially evacuated, placed on lockdown and surrounded by a police perimeter for almost three hours on Wednesday morning after a fatal shooting on the fourth floor, where the victim was visiting a patient, police said. Responding to a report of shots fired at CHI St. Vincent North just before 10 a.m., police found Leighton Whitfield, 21, of North Little Rock dead of at least one gunshot wound, Sherwood Police Chief Jeff Hagar said. Just over an hour later, Little Rock police took Raymond Lovett, 24, of Little Rock into custody at Zimmerman's Exxon, 5223 S. University Ave., after being alerted that a suspect in the shooting was at the gas station. Hagar said Lovett was turned over to his department, where he was being held Wednesday afternoon. A news release from the Sherwood department Wednesday night said Lovett had been charged with capital murder and aggravated assault. "I would like to personally say that our sympathy goes out to the family of the victim," Hagar said at an afternoon news conference at the Arkansas State Police headquarters. "It was a terrible thing that happened. "I would also like to tell everybody that's out there that this is not an act of terrorism... The suspect and the victim, they knew each other. It appears to be an isolated event that just happened to take place in a public facility."  The shooting prompted the evacuation of many patients and employees, although medical personnel on the hospital's second floor continued on with two surgeries that had already started, CHI St. Vincent CEO Chad Aduddell said. "Our people have been trained for an active shooter situation, so co-workers are aware to either run, hide or fight, and to some degree, at least, run and hide were tactics that were utilized," Aduddell said at the news conference. "We did have multiple surgeries, complex, difficult surgeries, that continued on as the incident was unfolding because they weren't at a time during the surgery where they could stop, and the staff and the surgeons made that decision in the best interest of the patient to continue." He praised the "unbelievable response" by police from several agencies and bravery of employees who continued to care for patients. The hospital will reexamine its security protocols in light of the shooting, he said. "We'll continue to drill," he said. "We'll continue to take all the precautions we can, but, as described, it's a hospital. There's many visitors coming in and out of our facilities every day, and so it's just a tragic situation." For almost three hours after the shooting, a large area around the hospital was cordoned off with police tape as hospital workers, some wearing blue scrubs, and relatives of employees and patients gathered in the parking lot of a nearby Academy Sports store. Among them was Jason Caldwell, whose father was at the hospital for surgery. "They can't get out of there right now because they are barricaded in the surgical room," Caldwell said around 11:30 a.m. Caldwell had been in a second-floor waiting room when he heard over the intercom that there was an active shooter on the fourth floor. He hid with his wife, mother and four other people in a bathroom while more announcements alerted patients and staff that the situation was not a drill. A few minutes later, police officers going door to door told them to stay put. Then a crew came to evacuate them. "We knew it was on the fourth floor ... so I was calm," Caldwell said of the shooting. "You see this on TV, and it just brought back to reality that there is evil in this world, and it shows its dirty head from time to time." Sean Lampley, an information technology engineer at the hospital, said he was on the first floor when a friend who works in radiology sent him a text message alerting him about the shooting. He stuck his head out of the room where he had been working and heard the announcement on the intercom: "Active shooter. This is not a drill." "I actually didn't know what to do honestly," Lampley said. "I didn't know if I should barricade myself or run." Then, he said, he saw coworkers running for the exits, and he did the same. "I took off after them, came out in the front parking lot, and we just saw the theatrics start. Officers, SWAT, and staff coming out of the hospital," Lampley said. Around noon, Nichole Morgan was closely watching her phone for updates from her daughter, a physical therapy technician at the hospital who was barricaded in a closet. She said her daughter began texting shortly after the shots were fired. "I wouldn't have thought here and I wouldn't have thought now," Morgan said, remarking on the surprise she felt when her daughter first alerted her. A man who declined to give his name said his wife, a nurse, was also barricaded inside. He said she was in an operating room with about two dozen other people, including health care workers and patients, with medical equipment pushed against the door. "It's where they were doing surgeries," the man said. "They can't stop." Naomi Castaneda, 36, and her mother, Leslie Brown, 54, both of Russellville, left the hospital about 9 a.m. after taking Brown's mother, Bobbie Haag, there for neck surgery. They were at a hotel when the surgeon called at about 11 a.m., just after the surgery, to tell them there had been a shooting. "Her doctor was concerned that we might have been in the hospital at the time, but luckily they both told us to go ahead and leave and they'd call us," Castaneda said. She said her grandmother had already been put under anesthesia when the lockdown occurred. Early Wednesday afternoon, Haag was still in the operating room, waiting for a hospital room. "She doesn't know anything about what's going on, thank God," Brown said. Cynthia Fuller and Debra Hicks said they had traveled 125 miles to visit a relative who was in the hospital. "My son is in there," Fuller said while waiting outside the police perimeter. "We came all this way and came up on this. All we could see is staff running." At On the Border restaurant next to the hospital, manager Zach Johnson said he was getting ready to open when five or six nurses knocked on the door at about 10:15 a.m. "They just told me there was an active shooter, and that they were evacuating the hospital," he said. "They asked if they could come in here until everything blew over and they caught the guy, so obviously I (let them in). We just locked the doors and waited until everything was clear."

        The Conway School Board on Wednesday decided to vote in two weeks on a policy that restricts transgender students, faculty and staff from using restrooms that align with their gender identity. The board is also set to vote during its Oct. 11 meeting on a policy that polices overnight stays for transgender students . "I've given more thought and energy to this in the 13 years that I've been on this board than any issue that we've had," said board President Andre' Acklin. Acklin added, "I've got to be able to sleep at night and if this is something that is not good for all the kids, even if it's a small portion, I'm still going to be concerned about it. If I have to stand alone I will." A line in the restroom policy says the rule will "ensure privacy and safety." The board discussed whether the two policies will stigmatize transgender students, faculty and staff -- creating an inherently discriminatory environment for them. Policies 4.20 and 4.56.2 establish rules within the district based on individuals' original birth certificate, even if they identify differently now. Both policies do not acknowledge risk that comes with requiring transgender individuals to request these accommodations. The board announced the proposed policies in early September. On Sept. 13, public attendance at the board meeting was so large the meeting was moved to the auditorium. Members of the school district, parents and students of surrounding Conway schools came out to show their frustrations with the board's proposed policies. "I'm a wife, mother of four and a Christian," said Conway resident Jenny Wallace at the Sept. 13 board meeting. Wallace believes the board is "pushing an agenda in the current culture war, while bullying Conway Public Students." Wallace reminded the board that several other districts in the nation have taken this route to restrict transgender individuals' access to restrooms and changing rooms before, only to lose lawsuits, business and money in court. Wallace also mentioned how a Virginia school board lost a similar case after implementing similar policies. She then asked the board a series of questions: "Where will that money come from? Will it come from the district? Will it come from our tax dollars? Will it come from the board members who are voting for discriminatory processes?" The crowd erupted with clapping, cheers and whistling after Wallace finished speaking. On Wednesday, the public turnout for the board's work session was the opposite of the previous board meeting. A handful of individuals attended the work session to review the two policies -- which was held in the school's administration building. Acklin kicked off the Wednesday conversation by asking Superintendent Jeff Collum, "If other districts in the state don't have policies like these, why are we leading the way?" Collum said, "I want to be clear that these policies are not required, but that the state says the restroom and overnight policies are "legally recommended." Other board members referenced an incident last year where two transgender students were staying in the same room on an overnight trip and a third girl in the room called her parents to complain. The situation was handled on an administrative level with the parents and the principal. Administrators at the meeting said the proposed policies highlight how these scenarios have always been handled. Collum said part of the goal of the two policies is to give faculty clear guidance on what to do when faced with these circumstances. Acklin suggested the policies be put on pause while they continue to navigate this "uncharted territory." "I don't want to misuse taxpayers money on a lawsuit that I feel would happen," said Acklin. Board member Jason Sandefer said, "These are real families, real parents and real students." Sandefer -- who seemed torn on the issue, calling it "more complex" than he originally thought -- said putting a pause on the policy would allow for the board members to alter the language to better serve both sides of the matter and hear more back from the community. Board member Trip Leach disagreed with the two, arguing in favor of bringing the policies to vote at the next board meeting. "I'm ready to vote and move on," said Leach. "There's no possible solution to satisfy everybody. We just have to make a decision that we feel is best for all kids and if some people disagree, I hate that and I'm sorry." Members of the board did not vote, but collectively agreed on bringing the two policies up for a vote on Oct. 11. The board also agreed to update a portion of the overnight policy before the next board meeting. The original policy stated that families of transgender students can pay for a reasonable accommodation on overnight trips if they do not wish to comply with the rule. That accommodation would include access to a single occupancy restroom or changing room. However, the board agreed on Wednesday that the district should pay for such an accommodation if it is requested. Collum reiterated that the board will be open to hearing more public comment on the two policies before the final vote on Oct. 11.

        Marijuana legalization could bring $460 million to the state's budget, according to a new study, but opponents said new revenue doesn't overcome increased costs. Voters will get a chance in November to weigh in on a constitutional amendment that if approved would legalize recreational cannabis in Arkansas. Sales of marijuana would be limited to those 21 or older. The Arkansas Economic Development Institute, which studied the economics of legalizing recreational cannabis, said new revenues from legal marijuana would total $460 million over five years. Legalization would bring $210 million to the state's general revenue funds, create around 6,400 new jobs and increase Arkansas' gross domestic product by $2.36 billion over five years, according to the study. "[We're] very direct in our aim [of] bringing forth an expanded responsible and well-regulated industry that supports law enforcement, cancer research, job creation and most importantly economic development," said Eddie Armstrong, chair of Responsible Growth Arkansas, a pro-marijuana legalization group. To come to the study's conclusion, economists used data from the state's medical cannabis industry and used a model from Regional Economic Modeling Inc. to simulate what effect legal recreational marijuana would have on the state's economy. Researchers also used data from other states such as Colorado, California and Washington that have legalized recreational marijuana. Michael Pakko, chief economist and state economic forecaster at the Arkansas Economic Development Institute, said he adjusted the model he used to account for the difference in Arkansas' population and income. Carlos Silva, also an economist at AEDI, co-wrote the study. Pakko said making projections for how large the marijuana industry is in Arkansas was difficult given the drug is illegal. "One of the challenging things about this whole topic is we're looking at a brand new industry, but one if you think about it already exists. It just exists in the underground black market economy, unmeasured and untaxed," Pakko said. Luke Niforatos, executive vice president of Smart Approaches to Marijuana, a group opposed to legalized cannabis, said voters shouldn't believe "pie in the sky" numbers. "Obviously they are going to promise the world because they want people to legalize it," Niforatos said. Niforatos said while states receive new revenues from taxes on marijuana, the costs of legalization outweigh any financial benefit. Niforatos said legalization means a new regulatory regime to oversee cannabis, increased car accidents from impaired drivers and hospital visits from adults and children who accidentally ingest the drug. "We should never have a discussion of revenues without a discussion of costs," Niforatos said. "Before any decision is made, voters should have an idea of what the cost is to the state." One benefit and cost is the effect legalization would have on cancer research in Arkansas. A portion of revenues from sales of medical cannabis goes toward funding cancer research. While recreational marijuana also could bring in funding for cancer research, whether the overall dollars for it increase or decrease is unclear. Responsible Growth Arkansas estimates the amendment would bring in $30 million for cancer research, but that could be offset by decreased revenues from medical cannabis sales. Armstrong said whether cancer research funding for the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences would increase or decrease if recreational marijuana is legalized is "speculative." "The big benefit for cancer research and for UAMS is the fact they could extract potential revenues from general revenue," Armstrong said. "And that will be left up to our legislative leaders and our government officials." If approved, the amendment would allow the state to issue cultivation and dispensary licenses for adult-use cannabis to businesses that already have similar licenses for medical marijuana. If approved, the state could issue an additional 40 licenses to other businesses through a lottery. Medicinal marijuana became legal in Arkansas after voters approved an amendment to the state's constitution in 2016. Researchers from the study estimate the state's sales tax would bring in $160 million over five years. County and municipal governments also will receive sales tax revenues from recreational marijuana totaling $92.6 million. If passed, the amendment would allow for a 10% supplemental sales tax on recreational marijuana that would bring in about $303.6 million, according to Responsible Growth Arkansas. Some of those sales will come from visitors to Arkansas who will either travel from neighboring states to purchase cannabis products or tourists from farther away who may become marijuana customers during their vacation to the Natural State. Pakko said his modeling shows marijuana tourism could benefit Arkansas' economy. "As the only state in the South with legal adult-use cannabis, we might expect a boost to the tourism industry, adding value via money spent on cannabis, in addition to typical tourist spending," according to an executive summary of the report. Niforatos, who lives in Colorado, which legalized recreational cannabis in 2012, said marijuana tourism can be an annoyance for some locals. "We are all sick of pot tourism in Colorado," Niforatos said. "It's not the desirable type of tourism you want to have in Arkansas."  Print Headline: Pot could bring state $460M, study finds

        A former Huntsville school superintendent and former basketball coach have been summoned to appear in Madison County District Court to face misdemeanor charges accusing them of failing to immediately call the Arkansas Child Abuse Hotline when they heard allegations of sexual abuse among boys on the junior high school basketball team. Prosecuting Attorney Matt Durrett said he issued the summonses Tuesday for Audra Kimball, the former superintendent, and Kaleb Houston, the former basketball coach. Both have resigned from those jobs, but Kimball is still employed by the Huntsville School District as director of personnel and program compliance. Kimball has been summoned to appear in court Oct. 6, and Houston's court date will be Nov. 3, said Durrett. He said official charges will be filed later. "The summons (at least in this case) is an acknowledgment of the charge and the court date," Durrett said in an email. "I did that in lieu of a criminal citation. It has the same effect." Kimball and Houston were each summoned under Arkansas Code Annotated § 12-18-201, "Failure to notify by a mandated reporter in the first degree." Durrett said there are still potential charges against other officials. In mid-April, Durrett said he wasn't going to file charges because the requirements of the mandated reporter statute, Arkansas Code Annotated § 12-18-402, didn't apply in this case. "A mandated reporter is required to file a hotline report when there is reasonable cause to believe that a child has been subjected to child maltreatment," Durrett said in an email in April. "'Child maltreatment' is defined as abuse, sexual abuse, neglect, sexual exploitation, or abandonment. Each of those terms is defined in [Arkansas Code Annotated] § 12-18-103. None of the statutory definitions fit the actions that were reported to school officials. Therefore, there was no legal requirement to file a hotline report. "Obviously, the prudent thing to do is to err on the side of caution and file a report. However, there was no legal requirement to do so. As such, we did not have a legal basis for filing charges." Durrett said he didn't have all the information in April. "I was under the belief that it was just exposure," he said in an email Wednesday. But the allegations went beyond exposure to include physical contact. The definition of "sexual abuse" under Arkansas Code Annotated § 12-18-103(20) includes "deviate sexual activity, or sexual contact by forcible compulsion" to a person under the age of 18, regardless of the age of the perpetrator. By late April, after getting backlash over his decision not to file charges, and concerns about whether there was a loophole in the law, Durrett told the Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, "We're in the process of gathering additional information that's out there. There were holes in the investigation that I should have looked at and seen that they were followed up on before making a decision." "Had I spoken to some of the families beforehand, I would have gotten more information," Durrett said in Wednesday's email. "That was my error, which is why I agreed to reconsider my decision." According to a "Title IX Sexual Harassment Determination of Responsibility" report completed after the school district's internal investigation, the accused players had placed their "genitals in the faces" of several eighth- and ninth-grade boys who were being restrained by other boys in the locker room after games. The practice -- called "baptism" -- occurred several times during the basketball season, as well as the previous year, according to the report. It didn't clarify exactly what "placing genitals in the faces" meant. Two boys admitted to "baptizing" other players, according to the report. Other boys were cited in the report as helping restrain the victims while they were being "baptized." Because they are underage and students, none of the boys' names were used in the report. The scandal spawned two lawsuits against the school district, one in state court and one in federal court. Rebecca Nelle was the plaintiff in the federal suit, which was settled after the Huntsville School Board voted to admit liability, pay $1 in damages and have school employees take Title IX training, in exchange for Joey McCutchen, Nelle's lawyer, waiving attorneys fees. Nelle's suit, which was filed on behalf of her son, provided definitions of "baptism" and "bean-dipping," another activity alleged to be taking place in the locker rooms. "Baptism,' as the term is used in this Complaint, refers to the placing of one's genitals on the face and/or in the mouth of another student," according to her lawsuit. "'Bean-dipping,' as the term is used in this Complaint, refers to placing a student's rectum and anus on the face and particularly the nose of another student." In mid-April, Durrett said he had asked Capt. Russell Alberts with the Madison County sheriff's office to write an incident report regarding the case. "Since we can't release the file due to the Child Maltreatment Act, we had Capt. Alberts do a summary," said Durrett. According to Alberts' report, besides Kimball and Houston, the investigation also revealed Athletic Director Tommy McCollough and High School Principal Roxanne Enix were also mandated reporters in accordance with § 12-18-402 and were "required to report incidents involving suspected or actual child maltreatment." The incident was brought to Enix's attention Feb. 9, 2021, according to Alberts' report. Enix would have been the first mandated reporter having knowledge of the incident, he wrote. (According to Nelle's lawsuit, a parent informed Houston about the locker-room abuse in October 2020.) The Child Abuse Hotline received six calls about the Huntsville case March 2, wrote Alberts. That was apparently after a formal complaint was filed and word was spreading in town. "However the incident does not meet the criteria of child maltreatment," according to Alberts' report. Sexual abuse, neglect, sexual exploitation and abandonment don't apply in this case, he wrote. Indecent exposure falls under the category of sexual abuse, but "even though there may have been an indecent exposure, there was no sexual gratification involved," according to the incident report. According to Arkansas Code Annotated 12-18-103,"'Indecent exposure' means the exposure by a person of the person's sexual organs for the purpose of arousing or gratifying the sexual desire of the person or of any other person under circumstances in which the person knows the conduct is likely to cause affront or alarm." "This leaves only abuse, which by definition refers to acts carried out by a parent, guardian or others as defined in 12-18-103 ... not the victims' peers," wrote Alberts. "Conclusion is that ... there was not a requirement to report the incident to the Arkansas Child Abuse Hotline," according to the report.

         FORT SMITH -- The city doesn't have to reinstall the Flags Over Fort Smith display at Riverfront Park, but must keep the flags and brass plaques it formerly displayed, according to Sebastian County Circuit Judge Gunner DeLay's ruling Tuesday. The display featured flags that have flown over Fort Smith since 1699 and included the French Fleur-De-Lis, the Spanish Cross of Burgundy, the French Tri-Color Flag, the U.S. 15-star, 20-star and 24-star flags and the Confederate flag. The waiver request to determine the disposition of the Riverfront Park flag display was the first to go before the Arkansas History Commission since the Arkansas State Capitol and Historical Monument Protection Act became law. The monument act became law in April 2021. It states except as permitted by law or authorized under the Arkansas History Commission, a historical monument cannot be moved, vandalized, damaged, destroyed, removed, altered, renamed or otherwise disturbed. The city decided the flags wouldn't be reinstalled and instead attempted to replace them with flags representing the six branches of the military. Earlier this month, a state panel decided the city must keep the Confederate flag as part of its display if the city wants to restore the monument.

        The Arkansas Ethics Commission has determined a Springdale senator and a former Republican House candidate violated state law by accepting contributions from entities not found on the list of permissible contributors. Sen. Colby Fulfer, R-Springdale, was fined $100 by the Arkansas Ethics Commission and was issued a public letter of caution for receiving a campaign contribution from an entity not on the list of permissible contributors and for failing to timely file his campaign contribution and expenditure reports for the special primary election and the special general election. The committee stated in documents that Fulfer's campaign contribution and expenditure report during the special election for the state senate contained an apparently illegal contribution Nov. 20, 2021. He listed a loan from Wilkins Homes for $20,000, but under campaign finance rules loans can only be made from one of two sources: a personal loan from the candidate to his campaign, or a loan from a financial institution to the candidate that the candidate then applied to the campaign. "The loan is clearly not a personal loan from you. There is no indication that Wilkins Homes is a financial institution," documents state. "If it is not a proper loan, then it must be considered a contribution from Wilkins Homes, and the amount of the contribution exceeds the donation limits to campaigns." The commission said the money was given at a time when it appears Fulfer didn't have a sufficient balance in his campaign fund to pay its expenses. "Listing it as a loan appears to be an attempt to evade campaign contribution limits," the commission said. The commission also said Fulfer violated the law by failing to timely file his campaign contribution and expenditure reports for the special primary election and the special general election. "The Commission noted that the time frame for filing reports was compressed in the special election, which contributed to the late filing of the final [campaign contribution and expenditure report] for the special primary election," the documents state. "Likewise, the Commission recognized that you were unable to file the final report for the special general election on March 30, 2022, because you were engaged in the City of Springdale's response to a tornado that occurred in Springdale that morning." Kenneth "Max" Blake, who ran for the Arkansas House District 48 seat but lost in the Republican primary, was issued a public letter of caution for receiving a $500 contribution from a limited liability company called W.D. Builders. The commission stated in documents that Blake unintentionally violated Arkansas law by accepting a contribution from an entity not found on the list of permissible contributors. "Pursuant to the terms of that offer, you have been issued a public letter of caution, which is the lowest level of public letter issued by the commission," the documents state.

        A long-running federal drug trafficking and racketeering prosecution that eventually involved 55 defendants and a total of 32 criminal counts was whittled down Wednesday as five of the defendants were sentenced to prison terms ranging from 90 months in federal prison to 17 years, making a total of 39 defendants sentenced so far. The investigation, dubbed Operation "To the Dirt," began in 2017 as an investigation into drug trafficking in Pope County that resulted in 44 indictments, but expanded in 2019 to include an additional 11 defendants and charges of racketeering and violent crimes in aid of racketeering, including kidnapping, maiming, assault and attempted murder. In all, 17 of the 55 defendants were charged with conspiracy to violate RICO, the Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations Act, or violent crimes in aid of racketeering, with nine of those also charged with drug conspiracy. The remaining 38 defendants were charged with conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine, possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine, or both. To date, 53 defendants have pleaded guilty in the case, and one defendant, Marcus Millsap, 54, of Danville, was convicted following a 14-day jury trial last year of conspiracy to violate RICO, attempted murder in aid of racketeering, and conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine. Millsap is currently awaiting sentencing. On Wednesday, one defendant, 35-year-old Russell Robinson of Russellville, was sentenced for violent crimes in aid of racketeering, for which he received 17 years in federal prison. Four people -- Jeffrey Howell, 37; April Teeter, 42; Richard Hampton, 44; and Tiffany Parker, 43 -- were sentenced on drug conspiracy counts. A fifth defendant, Lesa Standridge, 57, was due to be sentenced, but U.S. District Judge Brian Miller aborted the hearing after Standridge said she had not seen her pre-sentence report prior to Wednesday's sentencing hearing. Howell was sentenced to 188 months in prison, with the sentence to run concurrently with an 88-month sentence he is currently serving in California. Hampton and Parker were each sentenced to 96 months in prison, and Teeter was sentenced to 90 months. All were ordered to serve five years on supervised release after they leave prison. Howell, Teeter, Hampton, Parker and Standridge were initially indicted in the first wave of indictments in 2017. Robinson was indicted in 2019 in a superseding indictment handed up by a federal grand jury in February 2019 as part of a federal investigation into racketeering activities of the New Aryan Empire, a white supremacist gang that got its start in the 1990s as a jailhouse gang that soon moved into the state prison system and later out into communities around the state as members left prison. Robinson, who is currently serving a 15-year sentence in the Arkansas Department of Corrections after pleading guilty in Pope County Circuit Court in 2018 to first-degree battery and intimidating a juror, was indicted by a federal grand jury on four counts of violent crimes in aid of racketeering including kidnapping, maiming and assault with a dangerous weapon. The indictment came out of accusations that Robinson, along with several co-defendants in the 55-defendant indictment, kidnapped and tortured a man and woman from Pope County whom the gang believed to be providing information to law enforcement regarding a shooting involving another gang member. According to court records, Robinson -- along with co-defendants Timothy Ferguson, Kevin Long, Randall Rapp, Adam Mitchell, Christopher Buber, Bradley Chambers, April Howell, Shannon Ferguson and Amanda Rapp -- was indicted for the June 2017 kidnappings of an Atkins man, "H.D.," and a Dardanelle woman, "C.L.," whom gang members were attempting to prevent from testifying in a coming trial involving Long, who was charged with shooting at two men in Russellville on May 12, 2017. According to court records and testimony in Millsap's trial in September 2021, Robinson was among the group who kidnapped H.D. and C.L. and he assisted in assaulting H.D., whose face was disfigured when one of the group held a heated hunting knife blade against his face. According to trial testimony, the two were threatened, beaten and forced to sign letters of apology to Long before they were released. Robinson's attorney, Robert Golden, asked Miller to consider sentencing Robinson to a 15-year sentence, citing his brief criminal history with no prior violence until he committed the current offense. "This was a violent crime," Golden said. "There's no shying away from that, and he participated in that violence in a group setting." But, Golden said, in the three years he has represented Robinson his client has worked hard to turn his life around and to improve himself. "Mr. Robinson has accepted responsibility in this case twice now, he pleaded guilty on the state charge early on and he's taken responsibility here," Golden said. "I've spent three years now with Mr. Robinson and he's been a good client. He's a good human being ... I have a lot of clients and I can't say the same for all my clients that I can for Mr. Robinson." Since going to prison in 2017, Golden said, Robinson had availed himself of a number of programs in a concerted effort to rehabilitate himself, which Golden said was a sincere effort. "Obviously, when you're in prison, you want to come in here in front of a federal judge and say, 'Hey, I've done well,'" Golden said. "That's true, but many times, clients aren't able to do well for this long of a time, so I believe his commitment is genuine ... He's sorry for what he's done and he's ashamed his mother has to sit here and see him here." Miller said the underlying conduct in Robinson's case was different from the drug trafficking and conspiracy counts that had earned some of the defendants who have been sentenced to date prison terms in the 10- to 15-year range. "For a one count drug distribution case to go from 140 to 120 (months), that's 10 years," Miller said, "I think that's reasonable. But I think here, Mr. Robinson is looking at a lot more time." Miller said while he is sympathetic to the idea that attorneys and judges working within the system can become jaded when considering various sentencing structures while the viewpoint of those being sentenced is typically much different, there still have to be limits to what can be considered justification for granting leniency. "Some of us who work in the system may say it's only that amount of time, but none of us are going to spend one day in prison," he said. "So, any day he gets, or any month he gets, or any year he gets, that's a lot of time for him, right? I get it. But ... I typically don't give people credit for doing right from the day they're arrested or found guilty or come in for sentencing." Miller said in a few cases, "when they do something so amazing," he is inclined to offer leniency, "but typically, I don't." Assistant U.S. Attorney Liza Jane Brown, the lead prosecutor in the case, said she would not support a more lenient sentence given that doing so could create serious sentencing disparities with other defendants. She said also, the conduct of the offense did not lend itself to a more lenient sentence. "The conduct of which he is being sentenced for," she said, her voice dropping, "is just disheartening. I mean, it's egregious, it's terrible." Golden maintained his position that a 15-year sentence would be sufficient, but, "I understand the court disagrees." Robinson told Miller that he has "received correction and I'll continue to receive correction until I go home." "I'm ashamed," he said. "If I could do better I would. Thank you for your time." Miller ordered that Robinson's 17-year federal prison sentence be served concurrently with the 15-year sentence he is currently serving, and that he serve an additional five years on supervised release after he is freed from prison. With Wednesday's sentencings in the case, 39 defendants have been sentenced in the matter to prison terms ranging from three years to 35 years in prison. Fifteen defendants have been sentenced to prison terms of 15 years or more. Another 15 defendants remain to be sentenced, and one defendant, Troy "Tricky" Loadholdt, has been a fugitive since 2017.

        FAYETTEVILLE -- Community input will guide the city's heritage and historic preservation efforts over the next decade, according to the consultants hired to come up with a plan. The first public input session to shape a citywide heritage and historic preservation plan was held Wednesday at the Fayetteville Public Library. About a dozen people attended in person, with another dozen or so attending online via Zoom. Consultants Steph McDougal, with McDoux Preservation in Houston, Texas, and Emily Reed with Stantec Consulting Services in Austin, Texas, outlined the next steps and processes to develop the plan. The City Council hired the consultants in August using a $50,000 grant from the Arkansas Historic Preservation Program and $20,000 in city money. The city's first formal plan will explore the full spectrum of what the city could do in regard to historic preservation and what residents want to see happen, McDougal said. "This is going to be driven by what the community tells us they want -- what you want," she said. "We're not coming in to tell you what we think should happen, we're just providing information about what you might choose to do." For example, the consultants may recommend the city adopt regulations to address certain issues, but it'll be up to the city to write the ordinance, McDougal said. The plan will lay the foundation for work over the next 10 years, she said. Among the consultants' tasks are examining existing neighborhoods and historical assets, evaluating past preservation efforts and identifying places with the most historical significance. Significance, in the context of the plan, means places or structures that qualify for placement on the National Register of Historical Places or local designation for a landmark or historical district, McDougal said. Part of the plan will involve prioritizing historical resources for preservation, she said. The consultants will outline strategies and recommend a series of best practices. The consultants will offer more opportunities for the public to provide feedback, including a survey that will be posted soon to the city's Speak Up website, McDougal said. Participants were asked to place stickers labeled 1 through 4 on boards to prioritize four directions for the plan. Educating people about the city's history and historic preservation was the top vote-getter. Documenting and protecting historic properties received the most second votes. Regulating demolitions and redevelopment in neighborhoods received enough votes for No. 3. The last priority was promoting historic tourism. The consultants took questions from the participants for about 40 minutes. Sharon Killian asked how the plan would address gentrification impacting Black neighborhoods and historic places. Gentrification refers to the displacement of low- to moderate-income residents by wealthier residents, investors and businesses moving in. Many structures and places in the city have meaning for Black residents but have not been formally recognized and are dwindling in number, Killian said. McDougal said development, segregation and various forms of discrimination historically have made it difficult for Black residents to own property, preserve it and not be forced out of their own neighborhoods. Black neighborhoods historically have been under-appraised, making them targets for redevelopment, McDougal said. "I know development is rampant. Can we move fast enough? I don't know," she said. "But I know we're moving as fast as we can with this plan, and we're certainly going to be giving attention to that very specific issue." The process to develop the plan is scheduled to take a year. A draft plan should be ready for the public to comment on by end of winter, with revisions made in spring. A final plan is scheduled to be ready for the City Council to adopt next summer.

        LINCOLN — Fall brings to mind apples and apples bring to mind the Arkansas Apple Festival on Lincoln Square. This years festival will be the 46th celebration since the first one held in 1976. Mayor Doug Hutchens said the Apple Festival is Lincolns “signature event” and hes glad to see it back up to 100% this year. “Were back up running,” Hutchens said last week. Along with the three-day festival, the Apple Festival Pageant returned as part of the festivities this year. The pageant was held Sept. 24 at Lincoln Middle School. The annual parade begins at 10 a.m. Saturday, will start at the middle school and go around Lincoln Square. In the past, someone has announced parade entries but this year there will not be an announcer. Crowds showed up for the 44th Arkansas Apple Festival in 2019. The 2020 event was canceled because of the covid pandemic, one of many annual events in Northwest Arkansas canceled because of covid concerns and covid restrictions. However, the Apple Festival returned in 2021 with many people coming to Lincoln to enjoy the fall weekend featuring the festival parade, arts and crafts vendors, food concessions and the popular apple core throwing contest. The 2022 Apple Festival opens at 8 a.m. Friday for craft and food vendors and continues throughout the weekend on Saturday and Sunday. Vendors will close for this years festival at 5 p.m. Sunday. Rhonda Hulse, who chairs the Apple Festival Committee, said more than 80 vendors have registered to participate in the 2022 Apple Festival, with many of these taking up more than one booth space. Thats a little more than last year but not as many as the number of vendors that participated prior to the covid pandemic, Hulse said. “Were pretty full,” Hulse said. Visitors will have many choices from the food concessions. These items will include funnel cakes, corn dogs, nachos, chicken strips, smoked turkey legs, tacos, ice cream, fresh pork rinds and pulled pork sandwiches. Lincoln Kiwanis Club will have its traditional food concessions in the community building Friday through Sunday. The Kiwanis will offer beans and cornbread, chili and apple dumplings/vanilla ice cream. Proceeds help with college scholarships. The city sponsors the most popular spot at the Arkansas Apple Festival each year, freshly sliced apples handed out free by volunteers for visitors to enjoy. Another tent provides free samples of apple cider, along with cider that can be purchased. Hulse said the festival usually gives away 100 bushels of apple slices during the three days and sells about 500-600 gallons of apple cider. The Lincoln Masonic Lodge will have its regular tent set up to sell bags of fresh apples to patrons. Hulse, who has chaired the festival committee in a volunteer capacity since 2007, said this will probably be her last year as the chairwoman for the event. She said she will continue to help each year along with other city employees but believes it is time to hand over the baton to a new person. “Im basically putting on the whole festival,” Hulse said. “Yes, Ive had helpers but Ive got to where Ive been doing everything to get it together. “ She said the focus after this years festival will be to look for someone to take it over for the future. Hulse said she has enjoyed working with the Apple Festival and her favorite part has been working with the vendors and helping them as much as possible.
