        A fire at a Sheridan apartment complex on Monday killed one person, injured two others and left all 12 units uninhabitable, according to the chief of the Sheridan Fire Department. The victim was a 67-year-old woman, Sheridan Fire Chief Ben Hammond said Wednesday. Two other people suffered from minor burns and smoke inhalation, but both have been discharged, Hammond added. One of the units in the Birchwood Apartments, located on the 900 block of North Main Street less than a mile north of U.S. 270, caught fire. Hammond said the blaze spread to the rest of the complex, leaving all 12 units affected by some combination of fire, smoke and water damage. Hammond said foul play is not suspected, but the cause of the fire was uncertain as of Wednesday. “The apartment of [the fires] origins smoke alarm was not in the position it should have been,” he said, “It is important to have working smoke alarms that are installed correctly. I wholeheartedly believe that would have helped.”  The Arkansas chapter of the American Red Cross is providing some assistance to those displaced by the fire.  John Brimley, a spokesperson for the American Red Cross chapters in the state, said the Arkansas chapter has already assisted nine families. The funds provided can go toward recovery, new clothes and finding somewhere to stay.   The Arkansas Family and Resource Center of Grant County is also providing families with necessities, according to Laurie Welch, the executive director of the nonprofit.  Welch said on Wednesday that the center has helped at least 12 families that were displaced.  “We help them find a place and pay the deposit and three months rent,” she said. “The problem is that there is no place to rent here.”  The center has been able to provide clothes and food to those in need. According to Welch, the center will even help provide furniture once they have found a place to say, thought it has run out of beds and box springs.  “I know I have some on the way, but not enough for 12 families,” Welch said.  Welch added that the Sheridan community has been able to provide a lot through donations.  “They all pulled together and helped in numerous ways,” she said.

        Arkansas' count of coronavirus cases rose Wednesday by 812, a larger increase than was reported on Tuesday but smaller than the spike of 954 cases the previous Wednesday. The state's death toll from the virus, as tracked by the Arkansas Department of Health, rose by two, to 11,552. The number of covid-19 patients in the state's hospitals rose Wednesday by 15, to 193. The count had fallen for the previous two days after reaching 196 on Sunday. After rising slightly a day earlier, the average daily increase in the state's case count over a rolling seven-day period fell Wednesday to 699, down from the nearly four-month high of 727 a day that the average reached on Sunday. Wednesday's increase in total covid cases was the second daily increase in three days that was smaller than the one from the same day a week earlier. That breaks with a gradual upward trend in new cases that began in April. The number of covid-19 cases in the state that were considered active rose by 124, to 8,468, as new cases outpaced recoveries. It was the second consecutive daily increase in the state's active-case count, but still down from the nearly four-month high of 8,763 cases that were active as of Sunday. After rising the previous two days, the numbers of the state's virus patients who were on ventilators and in intensive care both fell Wednesday. The number who were on ventilators, previously at its highest level since April, fell by four, to 11. The number who were in intensive care, which had been at its highest level since March, fell by nine, to 32. Since the pandemic reached Arkansas in March 2020, the state Health Department has reported 857,119 cases of the coronavirus. Of those, 836,869 are considered recovered. More details in Thursday's Arkansas Democrat-Gazette.

        The Benton Police Department has made two arrests and issued 10 additional warrants in response to a June 6 shooting at an apartment complex that injured a 13-year-old girl, according to a news release on Tuesday. A 17-year-old male was taken into custody shortly after the shooting at Chapel Ridge of Benton, located on Alcoa Road about a mile south of Interstate 30. The news release states that the teen faces two counts of terroristic acts, as well as charges of first-degree battery, aggravated riot, minor in possession of a handgun, and unlawful discharge of a firearm in city limits.  Edward Eugene Hill, 52, surrendered after police obtained a warrant, according to the news release. Hill is facing first-degree battery charges and two counts of terroristic acts, as well as aggravated riot, possession of a firearm by certain persons and unlawful discharge of a firearm within city limits.  The release states that three more adults and seven juveniles will be charged with inciting a riot.  The Benton Police Department are asking that anyone with additional information relating to the shooting contact them at (501) 778-1171 or (501) 776-5947.

        A federal appeals court ruled Wednesday morning that a district court judge was right to dismiss a lawsuit filed by the Arkansas Times challenging an Arkansas law that added a pledge to not boycott Israel as a part of vendor contracts with the state of $1,000 or more. The ruling came after a full panel of judges heard arguments over whether or not Act 710 of 2017 violates free speech protections in the U.S. Constitution. The 10-judge panels main opinion found it likely that the Arkansas Supreme Court would find the anti-boycott law to govern solely commercial — rather than expressive — conduct. “It does not ban Arkansas Times from publicly criticizing Israel, or even protesting the statute itself. It only prohibits economic decisions that discriminate against Israel,” the opinion stated. “Because those commercial decisions are invisible to observers unless explained, they are not inherently expressive and do not implicate the First Amendment.” The courts opinion stated that a past U.S. Supreme Court ruling in a different case “held that First Amendment protection does not extend to non-expressive conduct intended to convey a political message.” Several states have enacted anti-boycott laws in contrast to the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, which advocates for economic measures against Israel because of actions described by supporters of the movement as human-rights violations against Palestinians. The Arkansas Times, a news publication in Little Rock, and attorneys with the American Civil Liberties Union sued in 2018 to block the law. The ACLU has challenged similar laws in other states. Brian Hauss, a staff attorney for the ACLU, in a statement called the judges' main opinion "wrong" and said a ruling will be sought from the U.S. Supreme Court. "The courts conclusion that politically-motivated consumer boycotts are not protected by the First Amendment misreads Supreme Court precedent and departs from this nations long standing traditions," Hauss said, calling boycotts "a fundamental part of American political discourse." "We hope and expect that the Supreme Court will set things right and reaffirm the nations historic commitment to providing robust protection to political boycotts," Hauss said. Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge — with support from 16 states — had requested that the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reconsider a February 2021 ruling by a three-judge panel that reversed a federal district judges dismissal of the Times lawsuit. Rutledge, in a statement, praised the ruling. “Today is a resounding victory for Arkansass anti-discrimination law and reinforces Arkansass relationship with our long-time ally, Israel,” said Attorney General Leslie Rutledge. “Arkansas had to spend taxpayer resources proving that Arkansas Times is not entitled to discriminate.” The opinion Wednesday morning from a panel of 10 judges included a formal dissent from U.S. Circuit Judge Jane Kelly. “An examination of the Act as a whole reveals that the legislature intended to prohibit commercial and expressive behavior,” Kelly wrote, citing how the law allows for the state to “consider specified ‘type[s] of evidence to determine whether ‘a company is participating in a boycott of Israel,” including a companys statement that it is participating in such a boycott. Kelly also cited how the law allows for the state to consider “evidence” of whether a boycott has taken place “at the request, in compliance with, or in furtherance of calls for a boycott of Israel.” Kelly stated in her dissenting opinion that “at a minimum, the State can consider a companys speech and association with others,” and that in “this way” the law “implicates the First Amendment rights of speech, assembly, association, and petition recognized to be constitutionally protected boycott activity.”

        Separate crashes killed two people and injured two others on Tuesday evening, authorities said.  Around 10:10 p.m., 45-year-old Martha Palomares-Zavala of Hope was driving east on Interstate 30, about a mile south of the Arkansas 108 exit, when she veered off the roadway to the right and struck a tree, according to a preliminary report from Arkansas State Police.  The report says Palomares-Zavala was pronounced dead at the scene by Dakota Bloyd, the Miller County coroner.  A passenger in the vehicle, a 36-year-old Hope man, was transported to Christus St. Michaels Hospital for treatment of his injuries.  Around 6:40 p.m., a 33-year-old Havana man was driving a 2015 Jeep east on Arkansas 10 in Logan County and attempted to pass a tractor-trailer, according to a preliminary Arkansas State Police report. The two vehicles crashed at the intersection of Arkansas 10 and Phillips Road, pushing the Jeep off the left side of the roadway. The impact killed a passenger in the Jeep, Christopher Elliot, 35, of Booneville. The Jeep's driver was taken to Mercy Hospital in Fort Smith for his injuries.  The roads were dry and the weather was clear at the time of both wrecks, according to authorities. Preliminary reports from the Arkansas Department of Public Safety indicate at least 255 people have died as a result of crashes on Arkansas roads so far this year.

        Last week, the Southern Baptist Convention held its annual conference in Anaheim, Calif. This years event, attended by thousands of delegates, known within the SBC as Messengers, was held under the shadow of a 288-page report released in May detailing the churchs handling of sexual abuse. The report described how top leadership within the organization not only ignored, but also at times treated with disdain, the individuals who approached them to report instances of child molestation and other forms of sexual abuse at the hands of pastors and church staff.  During the 2022 convention, delegates passed measures to combat sexual abuse, including the creation of a database of those involved as well as a resolution encouraging lawmakers to make it a crime for pastors to sexually abuse parishioners. There was also an apology to victims. New SBC leadership was also announced, including the election of Arkansas native Bart Barber as president of the largest Protestant denomination in the United States.  Democrat-Gazette religion editor Frank Lockwood, who attended the Southern Baptist Convention, joins Capitol & Scott host Lara Farrar to share insights into this years annual meeting as the leadership continues to grapple with nearly two decades of reports of sexual abuse that were buried to protect those at the top.  Email Frank Lockwood: flockwood@adgnewsroom.com Let us know what topics would you like to hear about in future episodes: arkansasonline.com/capitol-and-scott/

        WASHINGTON — U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton says he will oppose a bipartisan gun violence package after the release of legislative text that would put in place tougher gun laws. The 80-page measure released on Tuesday comes more than a week after a bipartisan group of senators announced a framework on mental health, school security and gun measures. Lawmakers are moving on the gun issue following a massacre at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas and a mass shooting at a supermarket in Buffalo, N.Y. Cotton, a Republican from Little Rock outlined his opposition to the bipartisan legislation in an interview on Wednesday, saying hes concerned about the “vague, undefined general terms” in the bill that violate “the rights of law-abiding citizens.” “Im worried again that its very vague in general and rather than Congress doing our job to define these things precisely, especially when youre talking about elements of criminal law, theyre leaving it to the courts,” he said. He expressed some support for portions of the legislation, but said there are more “worrisome” measures than positive provisions. One portion of the legislative proposal would strengthen background checks for gun buyers under 21 years old by requiring an investigative period to assess juvenile and mental health records. "I definitely think juvenile records should be in the background check system up to a certain age," he said. "I do worry again that that's been done in a very vague way that is going to put the thumb on the scale that anyone under the age of 21 will have a de facto 10-day waiting period." A bipartisan group of senators, including Sen. Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, and Sen. John Cornyn, a Republican from Texas, issued a statement Tuesday saying the legislation aims to keep schools safe, protect kids and cut down on the threat of violence. “Our legislation will save lives and will not infringe on any law-abiding Americans Second Amendment rights,” the group said in the statement. “We look forward to earning broad, bipartisan support and passing our commonsense legislation into law.” U.S. Sen. John Boozman, a Republican from Rogers, has said he's open to considering a bipartisan agreement. But he has stipulated that he wanted to see the specifics of the legislation. His office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.

         FAYETTEVILLE -- The city of Fayetteville has been designated a walk friendly community by Walk Friendly Communities, according to a press release from the group. Having been previously recognized in 2018, it is the only city in Arkansas to have received the honor. Walk Friendly Communities, a national recognition program developed to encourage cities to establish a high priority for safer walking environments, cites Fayetteville's "trail system, great planning practices, support for sidewalk construction and use of pedestrian hybrid beacons" as reasons for making it walk friendly for residents and visitors alike. Other contributing factors were the City's Active Transportation Plan and its 2018 Mobility Plan, which lays out a "qualitative approach to planning sidewalk and street projects," Fayetteville Mobility Coordinator Dane Eifling said.

        A 54-year-old woman has been charged with negligent homicide after a wreck in Fulton County left one man dead and another injured, according to court records. The driver of a 2004 Dodge Ram, Kamala Crone, 54, was southbound on Arkansas 9 at about 4:15 p.m. Friday when the vehicle crossed into the northbound lane and struck a 2013 Ford Edge head-on, authorities said. A passenger in the Ford, 45-year-old Robert Zeigler of Salem, was killed in the wreck. The driver of the Ford, a 65-year-old Salem man, was taken to Fulton County Hospital for his injuries, a preliminary report from the Salem Police Department states. Court records indicate charges filed against Crone include negligent homicide, driving while intoxicated and driving on a license that was suspended for a previous DWI infraction. On Saturday, a separate wreck killed a Benton man, troopers said.  Nathan Kirtley, 25, was driving his 2006 Ford Mustang north on Arkansas 229 in Benton around 10:30 p.m. when preliminary Arkansas State Police reports say the vehicle struck a metal guardrail, then went down the river embankment.  The vehicle came to a final rest upside down and fully submerged in the Saline River, facing southwest.  Authorities described the weather as clear and the roads as dry at the time of both wrecks.  At least 255 people have died as a result of crashes on Arkansas roads so far this year, preliminary figures from the state Department of Public Safety indicate.

         VAN BUREN -- Crawford County voters elected Chris Keith as their county judge and Daniel Perry as sheriff in runoff elections Tuesday. Keith won the Republican primary runoff, according to Bill Coleman, chairman of the county Election Commission. He will succeed Dennis Gilstrap, who has held the position since 2014 and didn't file for reelection. No other candidates filed for the seat. Unofficial vote totals are: Keith^2,639 (54%) Harvey^2,130 (44%) State law requires a runoff if no candidate gains a clear majority -- 50% plus one or more -- in the primary. The runoff takes place between the two candidates with the most primary votes. This is to ensure no candidate advances to the general election with only a plurality of their party's vote. During the May 24 primary, Keith get 4,187 votes (46%), while Harvey received 2,803 votes (31%). Republican Scott Overby, 47, garnered 2,139 votes (23%), according to official results on the Arkansas Secretary of State's website. In the runoff for sheriff, Perry defeated Shannon Gregory. Unofficial vote totals are: Perry^2,705 (56%) Gregory^2,074 (43%). Perry received 3,297 (35%) of votes, and Gregory got 2,654 (28%) on May 24. No Democrat filed for the office, so Perry will be the only name on the Nov. 8 general election ballot. The incumbent sheriff, Jim Damante, was appointed in 2021 to serve the remainder of Ron Brown's four-year term. Brown retired that year. Damante wasn't able to seek reelection under state law. Keith has been Crawford County's road superintendent for 15 years. He has worked for the county for 22 years under four county judges. This was his first time running for political office. Keith is also a board member for the Crawford-Sebastian Community Development Council and is on a board pertaining to walkability in the Crawford County area through the Western Arkansas Planning and Development District. Keith has said improving the county's road system is necessary to ensure it can accommodate the huge influx of people expected in the county. Keith also wants to work with all the mayors of cities in the county and possibly others to create an economic development plan for the county, he said. Harvey has served on the county Quorum Court as justice of the peace for District 5 since 2016 and is the owner of Turf & Pest Pro USA in Van Buren. Perry is a captain who supervises Van Buren's Police Department's patrol division. He's served in the department for almost 27 years, including 20 years in criminal investigations, nearly five years in narcotics with the 12th and 21st District Drug Task Forces and two years in administration over patrol. Perry's 32 years in law enforcement also includes time spent on the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force, Child Abduction Response Team and in the Magnolia Police Department. Arkansas county judges serve four-year terms. The annual salary for the Crawford County judge is $63,878, according to the County Clerk's Office. Arkansas county sheriffs serve four-year terms. The yearly salary for the position is $63,878, according to the County Clerk's Office. Print Headline: Keith gets nod for county judge

        BENTONVILLE -- The Planning Commission on Tuesday unanimously approved conditional use permits for projects around the city. Motto Hotel received approval for a laydown yard for when construction begins. The site area is a little over 5 acres on Southeast 14th Street. Hilton Hotels last year announced plans for the Motto Bentonville Downtown hotel on South Main Street. It will feature 175 rooms, an indoor bike garage, coffee bar, restaurant and an outdoor bar patio, according to a news release. It's scheduled to open in late 2023, according to Coyne PR, which represents Hilton. The use is proposed for 18 months while construction happens. Hours will be from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Saturday, according to planning documents. Shipping containers and job trailers will be the only indoor areas on site. There will not be any proposed site lighting, and average deliveries per day are not expected to exceed 10, according to planning documents. The applicant is LawFam Limited Partnership. A revised site plan shows a proposed concrete apron going 20 feet deep into the property on the Southwest A Street side. Another use permit was granted for a project at 801 S.E. G St., on the east corner of Southeast Eighth and Southeast G streets. The applicant is Food Hub NWA LLC. Crossland Heavy Construction wants to use the home as a construction office for two years while the Southwest Eighth Street improvement project is completed. The applicant also proposes to add more gravel to the existing gravel parking lot present on the north side of the property. The lot will provide safe and adequate parking for supervisory staff who will work in the temporary office, according to planning documents. A second conditional use also was granted at 802 S.W. E St. in conjunction with the same project. Crossland Heavy Construction proposed the installation of a gravel construction laydown yard along Southwest Eighth Street to store materials and tools during the completion of the street improvement project. The applicant is MAB Empresas LLC. In other business, the commission approved a conditional use permit, future lane use map amendment and rezoning for Patton Family Revocable Trust for property at East Centerton Boulevard and Southwest Tater Black Road. The future lane use map amendment was from residential estate to general commercial, and the rezoning was from agriculture to neighborhood commercial. The primary purpose for the rezoning request is to allow the applicant to sell the property to a developer to develop a chain drive-through restaurant, according to planning documents. The use permit is related to the restaurant. Parking, lighting, and the number of employees and patrons will be established during large-scale development. The applicant revised the proposed layout to show the trash receptacle 50 feet away from the nearby residential property line. It was the last meeting for commissioner Richard Binns, who has been on the commission for 18 years. The Planning Commission is made up of seven members.  Old Business In old business, the Bentonville Planning Commission on Tuesday approved: A future land use map amendment from low-density residential to medium-density residential at 903, 905 and 907 S.E. 10th St., a rezoning request from low-density residential to planned residential development and a waiver at the same address for 10th Ave Freeze Out LLC.

        FAYETTEVILLE -- Patrick Deakins won by 18 votes Tuesday night in his race for the Republican nomination for Washington County judge against Mark Scalise. Final but unofficial results are: Patrick Deakins2,623 (50%) Mark Scalise2,605 (49%) The results have not been certified. Deakins faces Democrat Josh Moody in the November general election. Moody defeated Charles Ward in the May 24 Democratic Party primary. Jennifer Price, Washington County's elections director, said there were four provisional ballots and one overseas absentee ballot still uncounted.  The Election Commission will meet at 9 a.m. Thursday to review the provisional ballots.  Price said the overseas absentee ballot has to be returned by July 1 in order to be counted. Price said there is no provision for an automatic recount in Arkansas elections. A candidate has 48 hours after the results are made public to ask for a recount. Scalise finished first with 6,445 votes (32%) and Deakins was second with 4,657 votes (23%) in the May 24 Republican Party primary. Sharon Lloyd came in third with 4,189 votes (21%) and Tom Terminella was the fourth-place finisher with 3,814 votes (19%) in that race. Since no candidate received a majority of the votes, the top two vote-getters advanced to the runoff. County judges are the chief executive officers for Arkansas county governments, overseeing the road department and other departments and maintaining county courthouses and jails. County judges serve four-year terms. The Washington County judge's salary is $141,470 annually. Deakins is a justice of the peace serving his second term on the Quorum Court. He said his first concern is to take care of county employees, including keeping pay and benefits competitive with the private sector. The Road Department has been constantly losing employees to private companies, he said. The Quorum Court recently approved a pay plan for Road Department employees, and Deakins said county government needs to monitor the department and others to ensure they don't fall behind. Deakins also said the county has to decide how to handle crowding at the jail. He has also said he favors the expansion plan proposed by Helder, and the county should use federal money if possible to offset at least some of the cost. Washington County voters also favored Gary Ricker over Aaron Wood in early voting to be the Republican Party nominee for justice of the peace for District 14. Final but unofficial results are: Aaron Wood242 (39%) Gary Ricker335 (54%) The Quorum Court is the legislative body of county government and is composed of 15 members called justices of the peace, who are elected to two-year terms. Democrats hold four of the seats, and Republicans hold 11. Each justice of the peace represents a district of roughly equal population. Redistricting for justice of the peace seats took place late last year. District 14 includes Greenland, West Fork and Winslow along with much of rural southern Washington County. Washington County justices of the peace are paid $200 per meeting for Quorum Court and committee meetings they attend. The Republican party nominee will face Democrat Dawn Cannon in the November general election. The incumbent, Jim Wilson, ran for the District 23 seat in the state House of Representatives. Gary Ricker retired as Greenland chief of police. In the May 24 primary election, Daniel Hitchcock received 320 votes (14%), Wood received 509 votes (23%), Ricker received 731 votes (33%) and Nikki Lockett received 354 votes (16%).

        FAYETTEVILLE -- City Council members on Tuesday agreed to compensate a couple whose home was extensively damaged after a water main break and, as a separate item, discussed proposed changes to water and sewer rates. The council voted 7-0 to pay residents Jim and Pat Knepp the full amount requested for damage to their home that was the result of a massive water main break in September. The home is on Makeig Court, a cul-de-sac off Warwick Drive in the northeast part of town. A 36-inch main burst about 6:30 p.m. Sept. 20. The break flooded neighborhood streets for several hours. Residents posted videos online showing what looked like river rapids running through the neighborhood. Millions of gallons of water were lost from the break. Residents were asked to conserve water until Sept. 23, when service was restored. The total reimbursement the Knepps requested was $40,707. The amount was to repair the foundation of the home, as well as for damaged landscaping and personal belongings. The amount also was to cover materials purchased and other related expenses for repairs done to the home. The city so far has provided the property owners $8,000, Utilities Director Tim Nyander said. Before the vote, the council approved increasing the dollar amount the city can compensate residents related to a damage claim from water or wastewater breaks. The move allows the city to pay a property owner up to $50,000 in an extraordinary case, raising the amount by 25% from $40,000. City Attorney Kit Williams said raising the amount was appropriate considering the original amount was set a decade ago, and inflation has set in since then. The council passed the change with an emergency clause, meaning it became effective upon adoption. In other business, the council heard a presentation from international consultant firm Black & Veatch on proposed changes to the city's water and sewer rates. Rates would remain the same for residents inside the city limits. However, rates could change for customers who live outside the city. Administrators said current rates can't support capital needs at the city's two wastewater treatment plants. The last rate study was done 14 years ago. West Fork Mayor Heith Caudle said a proposed increase in sewer rates would disproportionately affect his city's residents. West Fork finished hooking up its sewer service to Fayetteville in 2020. West Fork's former sewer treatment plant was obsolete, and in 2014, state inspectors found solid waste overflowing into the White River during heavy rain. West Fork agreed to a consent administrative order with the state to improve its infrastructure and to begin work to connect to Fayetteville's system. West Fork used bonds to pay for the $10 million project to connect its sewer service to Fayetteville. The two cities agreed to rates once the project finished. Caudle said West Fork has already had to use reserve money to pay for Fayetteville's pass-through sewer service. He asked the council to consider lowering his city's sewer rates, as opposed to raising them. A public hearing on the matter will be held July 19 at Fayetteville's City Hall.

        Former Arkansas Sen. Bryan King of Green Forest ousted state Sen. Bob Ballinger of Ozark in Tuesdays runoff election, four years after Ballinger beat King. State Rep. John Payton of Wilburn defeated state Sen. James Sturch of Batesville in a second state Senate runoff on Tuesday. In the third state Senate runoff Tuesday, businessman Tyler Dees of Siloam Springs handily beat state Rep. Gayle Hendren McKenzie of Gravette. State law requires a runoff between the two top vote-getters in the primary election if no candidate wins a majority of the votes in the primary. The state Senate is currently comprised of 27 Republicans, seven Democrats and independent Sen. Jim Hendren of Sulphur Springs. Ballinger and Sturch are the third and fourth Republican incumbents in the Senate to lose in this years primary and runoff elections. In the May 24 primary, Sen. Bill Sample of Hot Springs was defeated by Garland County Quorum Court member Matt McKee of Pearce. Sen. Charles Beckham of McNeil lost to Magnolia City Council member Steve Crow-ell in the primary. SENATE DISTRICT 28 The highest-profile state Senate runoff pitted King against Ballinger in a rematch of their battle in the 2018 Republican primary. With an estimated 99% of the vote counted, unofficial vote totals in the runoff were: King . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3,604 Ballinger . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2,917 King said Tuesday night that “this was a victory against big special interests. “It was the people that did it. It really was,” he said. “It certainly wasnt me.” B a l l i n ge r wasnt immediately available for comment by telephone Tuesday night. On Facebook, Ballinger said Tuesday night that “Things didnt go our way tonight. “We worked hard, but it wasnt meant to be,” he wrote on Facebook. “Our God is so good and our path is in His hands.” Ballinger said he appreciates the help from so many people and hes enjoyed meeting so many new people and making new friends during his Senate campaign. King will take on Eureka Springs Democrat Jim Wallace, an artist and owner of Paradise Pottery, in the Nov. 8 general election. Senate District 28 includes all of Carroll and Madison counties and parts of Boone, Franklin, Johnson and Newton counties. In November, the state Board of Apportionment redrew the boundaries of legislative districts. The board includes the governor, attorney general and secretary of state and redraws legislative district boundaries every 10 years based on information from the U.S. Census. In the May 24 primary, King garnered 4,863 votes while Ballinger tallied 4,465. Rep. Keith Slape of Compton received 2,936 votes, Harrison Regional Chamber of Commerce President/CEO Bob Largent picked up 1,578 votes, and Theodore (Ted) Walker of Huntsville got 1,461 votes, according to the secretary of states website. After the primary, Slape endorsed Ballinger in the runoff, calling him “a proven conservative voice.” Former Republican Gov. Mike Huckabee endorsed King in the primary. King is a cattle and poultry farmer who represented District 5 in the Senate from 2013-2019. District 5 includes Madison County and parts of Carroll, Crawford, Franklin, Johnson, Sebastian and Washington counties. He served in the state House of Representatives from 2007-2013. Ballinger is a lawyer and has represented District 5 in the Senate since 2019. He previously served in the state House of Representatives from 2013-2019. In the 2018 primary, Ballinger garnered 4,245 votes compared to Kings 3,871 votes. Through June 11, King reported raising $37,110 in contributions, loaning his campaign $120,511.13 and spending $163,325.74, leaving a balance of $8,935.39. In contrast, Ballinger reported raising $117,370 in contributions and spending $77,430.02 through June 11, leaving a balance of $39,939.98. SENATE DISTRICT 22 In his bid to oust Sturch, Payton focused on Sturchs 2021 vote against a bill that aimed to prevent public schools from teaching that the United States is systemically racist. Sturch defe n d e d h i s vote against the measure by pointing out that he voted for a separate bill that placed into law a process for parents to challenge curricula they feel are misleading, inaccurate or otherwise inappropriate. With an estimated 99% of the vote counted, unofficial vote totals in the Republican runoff were: Payton . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3,732 Sturch . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2,634 Pay to n sa i d Tu e s d ay night that he believes he beat Sturch in part due to tons of hard work by his supporters and “God blessed the hard work. “The people are very conservative in Senate District 22 and they appreciated our message,” he said. Sturchs vote against the bill aimed at banning the teaching the tenets of critical race theory in public schools was an example of Sturch not voting in concert with his constituents, Payton said. Sturch said Tuesday night that the “result was of course not what we had worked toward. “We fought hard right till the last hour,” he said in a text message. Sturch said he has no regrets in the way “we ran our campaign with integrity and focusing on the real issues. “I wish Representative Payton the very best, as I wish the very best for Arkansas,” he said. “I will continue to try to find a way where I can serve others.” Payton will be unopposed in the Nov. 8 general election. Senate District 22 includes Lawrence and Sharp counties and parts of Cleburne, Fulton, Lawrence and Izard counties. In the Republican primary, Payton received 6,281 votes compared with Sturchs 5,353 votes, and the third candidate, Ethan Barnes of Hardy, tallied 3,571 votes, according to the secretary of states website. Payton has been in the state House of Representatives since 2013. He owns two auction and two used-car lots. Sturch has served in the Senate since 2019 and was in the House of Representatives from 2015-2019. In the 2018 GOP primary, Sturch ousted the late Sen. Linda Collins-Smith of Pocahontas in Senate District 19. That district includes Independence, Izard and Sharp counties and parts of Fulton and Randolph counties. Ken Yangs American Dream Strategies is a campaign consultant for Payton. Yang tweeted Tuesday night, “Congratulations@RepJohn Payton! Youll be a great State Senator. Linda is smiling.” In the runoff, Sturchs supporters include Attorney General Leslie Rutledge, who is the GOP nominee for lieutenant governor, and Huckabee, the former Republican governor. But earlier this year the Republican committees in Independence and Izard counties voted not to recommend Sturch in what is a rarely taken action in state Republican Party circles. Paytons supporters include Lt. Gov. Tim Griffin, who is the Republican nominee for attorney general. The Conduit for Action groups co-founder Brenda Vassaur-Taylor of Fayetteville said the conservative group likes Paytons voting record. Through June 11, Payton reported raising $35,309.51 in contributions, loaning his campaign $85,000 and spending $70,656.79, leaving a balance of $49,666.49. In contrast, Sturch reported raising $136,718.31 in contributions, loaning his campaign $1,011.61 and spending $109,522.24 through June 11, leaving a balance of $28,707.68. SENATE DISTRICT 35 Dees and McKenzie vied for the Republican nomination in the Senate District 35, where McKenzies brother, Jim Hendren of Sulphur Springs, isnt seeking re-election. Jim Hendren and McKenzies father, Kim Hendren of Gravette, served in the state Senate and the state House of Representatives. With an estimated 99% of the vote, the unofficial vote totals in the Republican runoff were: Dees . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2,949 McKenzie . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1,714 Dees will face Libertarian candidate Doug Peterson of Prairie Grove in the Nov. 8 general election. Senate District 35 includes western Benton and Washington counties. In the May 24 primary, Dees tallied 4,292 votes compared to McKenzies 3,162 votes and the third candidate, Jeff Tennant of Gentry, picked up 1,934 votes, according to the secretary of states website. After the primary, Tennant endorsed Dees. Dees is director of business development at Simmons Foods. McKenzie, who has a decorative stone business, has been in the House of Representatives since 2019. Through June 11, Dees reported raising $103,625 in contributions, loaning his campaign $7,500 and spending $85,367.57, leaving a balance of $25,757.43. In contrast, McKenzie reported raising $45,841.35 in contributions, loaning her campaign $6,000 and spending $46,897.53 through June 11, leaving a balance of $4,943.82.

        A Republican incumbent lost his seat in the Arkansas House of Representatives on Tuesday night in the primary runoff election, while another staved off his challenger. State Rep. Marsh Davis, R-Cherokee Village, lost his House District 2 seat to primary challenger Trey Steimel, an insurance agent from Pocahontas. Meanwhile, House Republican leader Marcus Richmond of Gravelly fended off challenger Mike Jones in the House District 52 GOP primary. After Tuesday's runoffs, four incumbents have been ousted so far. There were Republican primary runoffs for seven state House seats Tuesday to determine the party's nominees. Runoff elections were held for the top two vote-getters in primary races in which no candidate received a majority of the vote in the May 24 primary. HOUSE DISTRICT 2 Steimel, in the District 2 Republican primary, attacked Davis for being absent in the Northeast Arkansas district, saying recently he would bring back local representation and accessibility to the House seat. "[Davis] is not engaged in our local communities when he is not in office in Little Rock," he said. "When you aren't in Little Rock for sessions and committee meetings then you need to be at quorum courts and city council meetings to find out what the folks need from you and that is not what is happening right now." Steimel will face Libertarian Teresa Norman in the general election for House District 2. He couldn't be reached for comment Tuesday night. With an estimated 99% of votes counted, unofficial returns were: Steimel 1,064 Davis 749 Davis, whose first term in the House was in 2019, previously said he wasn't surprised that his race went into a runoff. "Anytime there are three or more candidates in a race, there is always an above-average chance it's going to a runoff," he said. Davis received an endorsement last week from his previous opponent, Hazell Marie Whited. HOUSE DISTRICT 52 Richmond, whose first term in the House began in 2015, said he received an endorsement from Republican gubernatorial nominee Sarah Huckabee Sanders of Little Rock a few weeks ago. "We put it out there and kind of let other people make a big deal about it," he said. "I try not to overplay anything that we got going on. ... I really do appreciate her stepping up and doing that for me." But Jones said he doesn't think Sanders' endorsement of Richmond "has a whole lot of traction." "We haven't heard that that really hurt us," he said. Richmond will face independent John Wayne Catlett in November. Richmond couldn't be reached for comment late Tuesday. With an estimated 99.9% of votes counted, unofficial returns were: Richmond 1,160 Jones 673 Richmond said during the runoff he was making sure he reached out to not only those who voted for him but also those who voted for a third primary candidate, Greg Bland. "I need to show those who voted for Bland that I am the better choice and again show the people who voted for Jones why they should reconsider that vote," he said. Jones is a farmer and rancher for 13 Cattle Co. in Pope and Yell counties as well as the president of J & J Farm and Equipment in Dardanelle. HOUSE DISTRICT 39 In House District 39, Jackson County Quorum Court member Wayne Long defeated Independence County Judge Robert Griffin. Rep. Craig Christiansen, R-Bald Knob, a second-term representative, was ousted in the three-way GOP race during the primary election. Long will face Libertarian candidate Clayton Hall in November. With an estimated 87.5% of votes counted, unofficial returns were: Long 832 Griffin 588 HOUSE DISTRICT 27 Steven Walker defeated Timmy Reid in the GOP primary to succeed state Rep. Keith Slape, R-Compton, in House District 27 on Tuesday. Slape vacated the seat to run for state Senate. With an estimated 99% of votes counted, unofficial returns were: Walker 2,663 Reid 2,339 Walker will be unopposed in November's general election. NORTHWEST ARKANSAS In Northwest Arkansas, three Republican primaries were decided by runoffs Tuesday. Hope Hendren Duke defeated Jay Oliphant in House District 12. With an estimated 99.9% of votes counted, unofficial returns were: Duke 1,071 Oliphant 496 Duke will face Libertarian D. Michael Gill in November. Scott Richardson defeated Denise Bugos in House District 13 With an estimated 58.4% of votes counted, unofficial returns were: Richardson 485 Bugos 327 Richardson will face Democrat Jen Standerfer in November's general election. Kendra Moore defeated Jim Wilson in House District 23. With an estimated 99.9% of votes counted, unofficial returns were: Moore 931 Wilson 700 Moore faces Libertarian Ryan Hanson in November.

        Leading a large public university means having a vision for its role in the state and region, the finalists for the top campus administrator at Arkansas State University said in cover letters vying to become the schools next chancellor. “Simply put, Chancellors think big and work hard to rally the community around bold goals,” wrote Lance Tatum, the top academic officer at Troy University in Alabama. Four finalists for the ASU chancellor job are visiting the Jonesboro campus, with Tatum set to give the first open forum presentation today. Each finalist will also meet with students, staff and faculty members during visits that stretch over two days. The finalists are seek-i n g to re pl a ce Ke l ly Damphousse, who is taking a job as president of Texas State University after serving as ASU chancellor since July 2017. The finalists have all spent the large majority of their careers in higher education, and — though three would be arriving from outside Arkansas — each also has ties to the state. Walter Kimbrough, 55, is the outgoing president of Dillard University in New Orleans. He formerly served from 2004-2012 as president of Philander Smith College in Little Rock. Both are private institutions and historically Black colleges. Karen Petersen, 49, is dean of the Henry Kendall College of Arts & Sciences at the University of Tulsa. Petersen was born in Huntsville and her husband was born in Paragould, which is roughly 20 miles northeast of Jonesboro, she said in an email to the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, and both have family in Arkansas. Todd Shields, 53, has been dean since 2014 of the University of Arkansas, Fayettevilles J. William Fulbright College of Arts and Sciences. Shields began at UA in 1994 as an assistant professor in the Department of Political Science. Tatum, 57, has worked at Troy University since 1998, when he joined as an assistant professor of sport and fitness management. In a text message, Tatum said he was born in Brinkley in the Arkansas Delta region about 75 miles southwest of Jonesboro, with both his parents having family roots in the area. He left the state when his family moved to Pennsylvania in 1974, he said. WORKING WITH THE COMMUNITY In cover letters released by the ASU System to the Democrat-Gazette, candidates touched on the importance of ASU to the region while also going into detail about their own backgrounds and experience. “Arkansas State University is in a strategically advantageous position to play a central role in the future success of Northeast Arkansas,” wrote Shields in his cover letter. Others also wrote about the importance of a university to its surroundings. A university like ASU “should be a welcoming place that residents want to visit,” Petersen stated in her letter. Universities like ASU “serve as the driving force for economic development, cultural engagement, athletic opportunities, and social mobility and should seek to serve all who reside within their influence,” wrote Petersen. Petersen referred to ASUs planned Arts and Innovation District as “only the latest in a series of improvements at ASU” that will help the city of Jonesboro reach goals outlined in an economic development effort called Momentum Jonesboro 2.0. “In essence, ASU is transforming Northeast Arkansas and adding value far beyond the boundaries of its campus — which is exactly what public universities should be doing,” Petersen wrote. She also referred to her past experience at Middle Tennessee State University, a public university where she worked for 16 years, including as dean, and she described partnerships with local high schools in support of humanities and the arts. Petersen earned her bachelors degree in international relations from Middle Tennessee State University. Kimbrough referred to time hes spent off campus working with the New Orleans community around Dillard University. “I am a more than capable ambassador and communicator. I am very active in New Orleans with both the city and regional chambers and serve on two commissions appointed by the Governor of Louisiana,” Kimbrough wrote. He also highlighted his past in Arkansas. “Spending seven and a half years in Little Rock will be a plus in connecting and reconnecting with people in Arkansas,” Kimbrough wrote. Tatum wrote about his experience working with elected officials in Alabama, where he stated that “maintaining and strengthening our relationship with key members in the state legislature and the Alabama Commission on Higher Education has been critical to our success.” FINDING THEIR WAY In describing why they want the job, some candidates in their letters talked about their own journeys in higher education. Kimbrough emphasized the importance of being a top leader. “Let me address the obvious. It might seem challenging for me to jump from a university of 1,200 students to one of over 13,000. I know people thought the same when Bill Clinton ran for President of the United States, an enterprise 100 times larger than Arkansas,” Kimbrough stated. He said that when leading small institutions, “there is nowhere to hide.” “By being at a small, under resourced institution, not only do you wear many hats, but you also have an opportunity to have hands on experiences with a wide range of areas, experiences a person who leads a division of larger entities never sees until they are president,” Kimbrough stated. In his letter, he also touted raising graduation rates to 50% at a school where about three out of every four students are eligible for Pell grants, a type of federal financial aid for students with exceptional need. Kimbrough added that he has “a national presence as a leader in higher education,” which has included working with organizations such as the Bipartisan Policy Center think tank as well as recently giving testimony before Congress after bomb threats were made targeting historically Black colleges and universities. Shields wrote that “since my first day as an administrator,” he has “led by example, setting high standards for myself and for those with whom I work.” Describing himself as a “positive, fair, and meticulous person,” Shields stated that he strives “to understand what motivates people.” He also wrote about fundraising, stating its importance to UA. “Without increases in state support or tuition, we spent an enormous amount of time devoted to fundraising,” Shields wrote, going on to give a description of how he views efforts to raise money. “Fundraising is a process that begins with building close relationships with individuals, understanding their interests, and persuasively communicating the colleges most pressing priorities, a process I find energizing and rewarding, especially when it yields new opportunities for the university,” Shields wrote. Petersen, in her letter, described herself as a “first-generation student educated at a regional university,” where “my potential was unleashed by caring faculty and staff members just like those at Arkansas State University.” Her letter stated that she took the University of Tulsa job “to be closer to my family in Arkansas,” and that the ASU job “appeals to me both personally and professionally.” She wrote about her experience at the University of Tulsa, which in 2019 announced the elimination of some degree programs. Petersen joined the private university in February of last year. “Honest, direct communication about the challenges we face, a genuine appreciation for the role our faculty and staff play in securing the future of the university, and a commitment to shared governance have allowed me to begin rebuilding trust quickly,” Petersen wrote. Petersen in her letter also described herself as the “parent of a student athlete.” In an email to the Democrat-Gazette, she wrote that her son plays football at Gustavus Adolphus College in Minnesota, which competes at the NCAA Division III level. ASU sports are considered Division I, the highest level of competition. “Athletic programs serve an important role in recruiting and fundraising because of the value they bring to the lives of participants and our community,” Petersen wrote in her cover letter. Tatum wrote that the “servant-leader model is central to my approach to leadership,” and that his “governance style can best be described as a participatory/consultative decision-making process.” He also wrote that his academic background and interests are tied to sports, that he previously spent eight years as the faculty athletics representative for Troy University, and also that he has been “regularly asked to participate” on behalf of the universitys chancellor in meetings held by the Sun Belt athletic conference, which includes ASU as a member. “I have the passion, energy, and experience to continue the growth and exposure of the universitys athletics program,” Tatum wrote.

         An uptick in Arkansas' new coronavirus cases resumed on Tuesday as the state continued the rollout of covid-19 vaccines for children younger than 5. State Department of Health Director Jennifer Dillaha said all 30,000 doses in the state's initial order of vaccines for the newly eligible age group arrived in the state on Monday. Those doses, evenly split between Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, were shipped to nine of the department's local health units. Those units were distributing the doses to other local health units around the state as well as to private clinics and pharmacies, Dillaha said. She said at least two shipments from the state's second order were expected on Tuesday. The state was waiting on an expected delivery date for three other shipments. Dillaha predicted the uptake among children would be "slow but steady." "I think parents need some time to get the information that's newly available about the vaccines in order to make an informed decision about vaccinating their children," Dillaha said. Little Rock's Kavanaugh Pharmacy, which received its first doses for the new age group on Monday, had vaccinated about a dozen children by Tuesday afternoon, co-owner Anne Pace said. She said the store had also fielded 30 to 40 calls on Tuesday from parents, including some who were angry the store can't vaccinate children younger than 3 -- a limitation set in state and federal laws. "It's not that we don't want to, we just cannot," Pace said. She said the uptake so far has been slower than it was for children ages 5 to 11, who became eligible for a pediatric version of the Pfizer vaccine in November. The first few weeks after that vaccine first became available, the pharmacy was vaccinating about 100 children a day, Pace said. "At that point, we still had our vaccine center, and we had a line out the door," Pace said. "We had to enforce having appointments, because we had a small amount [of vaccine] at that time." The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Friday authorized the Pfizer vaccine for children from 6 months to 4 years of age and the Moderna vaccine for ages 6 months to 5 years. Both vaccines are low-dose versions of the companies' shots that are available to adults. Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, on Saturday endorsed an advisory committee's recommendation that all eligible children receive a vaccine, clearing the way for providers to begin administering the shots.    A vaccine hadn't previously been cleared for children under 5. Dr. Susan Averitt, president of the Arkansas chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said a few dozen of her patients have signed up to be notified once her clinics in Fayetteville and Springdale have doses for the new age group. She's hoping to get an initial supply from the local health unit in Fayetteville by the end of the week. "I think that we will have quite a few parents who will opt to get it right away, and then we'll have quite a few parents who are either waiting until their next checkup or waiting until they talk to us to see what we think," she said. Anna Strong, the chapter's executive director, said the vaccine should be widely available at clinics by the end of the week. She made an appointment to get the vaccine for her own 14-month-old son at a Little Rock clinic on Friday. Her other son got his first shot in March, after he turned 5. "I'm just super excited to have my full family vaccinated so we can get back to life as we knew it before the pandemic," she said. Arkansas Children's plans to offer the Pfizer vaccine for children under 5 at its primary care clinics around the state, spokeswoman Hilary DeMillo said in an email. "We expect our vaccine supply for children under 5 to arrive later this week and encourage families to talk to their child's doctor about vaccinating," DeMillo said. "Caregivers will be able to make an appointment for the vaccine at www.archildrens.org/getmyvaccine when our supply arrives." Outside of the state's vaccine program, some drugstores, including Walmart and Walgreens pharmacies, receive shipments of doses through the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program for COVID-19 Vaccination. On its website, Walmart said it is now administering covid-19 vaccines to children ages 3 and older. The site didn't show any available appointments at stores in Central Arkansas for children under 5 as of Tuesday afternoon, however. Walgreens said it was taking appointments on its website for vaccinations for 3- and 4-year-olds that will begin Saturday. The website showed appointments available at stores in Little Rock as soon as Monday. FEWER HOSPITALIZED Meanwhile, Arkansas' count of coronavirus cases rose Tuesday by 764 -- about three times the size of the daily increase a day earlier but only larger by 24 than the rise the previous Tuesday. Declining for the second day in a row, the number of covid-19 patients in the state's hospitals fell by three, to 178. The state's death toll from the virus, as tracked by the Arkansas Department of Health, rose by 10, to 11,550. Health Department spokeswoman Katie White said five of the deaths reported Tuesday happened within the past month. Of the others, one was from October, one was from January, one was from February and two were from May. After dipping a day earlier, the average daily increase in the state's case count over a rolling seven-day period rose to 719, which was still down from a recent high of 727 a day that the average reached on Sunday. Similarly, with new cases outnumbering infections, the number of cases in the state that were considered active rose by 37, to 8,344, after falling on Monday. The total as of Tuesday was still below a nearly four-month high of 8,763 cases that were active as of Sunday. Dillaha noted that the total, which had been growing by about 2,000 a week, was only up by about 1,200 on Tuesday compared to a week earlier. "I think that's a good sign that maybe the rate of increase is not as high at the moment," she said. ESTIMATES UPDATED According to CDC estimates updated Tuesday, a growing proportion of cases nationwide, and particularly in a region encompassing Arkansas, are being caused by two strains of the omicron variant that initially gained attention for causing a resurgence of infections in South Africa in April and May. Across the United States, the two strains, known as BA.4 and BA.5, accounted for almost 35% of new cases last week, up from about 23% the previous week, according to the CDC. Among the U.S. Health and Human Services Department's 10 regions, the estimated percentage of cases caused by the two subvariants was highest in the one encompassing Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas. In that region, BA.4 and BA.5 were responsible for an estimated 42.5% of cases last week, up from 29.3% the previous week. Another subvariant, BA.2.12.1, remained dominant nationwide, although the estimated percentage of cases it caused nationwide declined for the second week in a row, going from 62.7% the week ending June 11 to 56% last week. In the Health and Human Services region including Arkansas, the percentage of cases caused by BA.2.12.1 fell from 56.1% the week ending June 11 to 48.7% last week. CASES BY COUNTY Within Arkansas, Pulaski County had the most new cases, 97, on Tuesday, followed by Faulkner County with 55 and Washington County with 44. The state's cumulative count of cases since March 2020 rose to 856,307. Rising for the second day in a row, the number of the state's virus patients who were on ventilators grew by two, to 15, its highest level since April 21. Also growing for the second straight day, the number who were in intensive care rose by eight, to 41, the largest number since March 26. At its hospitals in Little Rock and Springdale, Arkansas Children's had eight covid-19 patients on Tuesday, up from seven on Monday, DeMillo said.

         A member of the Little Rock Board of Directors withdrew her alternative proposal on Tuesday for how to divvy up most of the money in the second tranche of federal funding to the city from the American Rescue Plan Act. City Director Doris Wright, who represents Ward 6, asked that the resolution be withdrawn at the start of the board meeting before a vote could be taken on whether to add it to the agenda. Adding the item would have required a supermajority vote by board members. Wright indicated she wanted to bring back the resolution at a later date. "I feel that we need to focus on our upcoming millage election on Aug. 9 and I believe it's a distraction so ... as the author I am withdrawing it at this time," Wright said during the meeting. The city's second and final tranche of nearly $19 million was recently received from the federal government. Little Rock received the first half of its total allocation of more than $37 million in May 2021 as part of the Biden administration's covid-19 economic recovery package. Signed in March 2021, the American Rescue Plan Act included $350 billion in direct aid to non-federal governmental entities, including Arkansas' capital city. Wright's resolution, which was discussed at a board meeting last week, departed in several ways from the initial spending plan compiled by city staff and brought forward by Emily Jordan Cox, the city's intergovernmental relations manager, at a May 31 meeting.    Among the changes, Wright's version would add $1 million in funding for a senior center (for a total of $3 million), $1 million for parks and community centers (for a total of $3 million) and $1 million for downtown capital needs as well as a master plan (for a total of $1.5 million). The additional money for parks and community centers would be earmarked for the baseball fields at the West Central Community Center, according to Wright's resolution. The complex is located in her ward. Wright's proposal left out spending on items such as affordable housing, ensuring access to healthy food and community-violence intervention programs that were outlined in the original proposal from city staff. A $2.35 million allocation for the Public Works Department was left unchanged under Wright's version. So was a $1 million allocation for the Little Rock Police Department's proposed real-time crime center, which recently got the approval of the city board and is expected to be housed in the department's new West Markham Street headquarters once the building opens. Both plans would allocate $12.35 million from the second tranche of federal aid, leaving roughly $6.5 million to be allocated at another time. During the Aug. 9 capital-improvement millage referendum Wright referenced at Tuesday's meeting, voters will be asked to approve an extension on three mills. If the extended property-tax levy is approved, the city plans to issue up to $161.8 million in bonds and spend the money on items such as street and drainage improvements, a new district court building and expansion of the Port of Little Rock's industrial park.

         The Arkansas School Safety Commission discussed a slew of recommendations Tuesday about what can be done to improve safety at Arkansas schools, but commissioners will have to determine how to pay for such measures. Automated locking doors, license plate readers, layered anonymous reporting options and more unified training programs were among the recommendations presented by commission subcommittees, which also provided updates on the progress schools have made on recommendations from 2018. Dr. Cheryl May, director for the Criminal Justice Institute and head of the Arkansas School Safety Commission, said "tremendous progress" has been made based off subcommittee reports but there is still work that needs to be done. "We need to be able to refine and provide additional guidance, but there are some areas that I have talked about before, and that is the threat part of it," May said. "How do we handle and identify threats? Also, from the physical security perspective, being able to prioritize what is most important for our schools is going to be critical in helping our schools move forward." Gov. Asa Hutchinson reinstated the Arkansas School Safety Commission on June 10 in the aftermath of several mass shootings across the nation, including the May 24 school shooting that left 19 children and two adults dead in Uvalde, Texas. Members of the original commission created in March 2018 submitted 30 recommendations in their original 124-page report, and school districts across the state have implemented many of the recommendations, according to the governor's office. Under the governor's executive order, the commission will review its final report published in November 2018 and provide an update on the status of school safety across the state. The commission has been charged with updating an analysis of the safety of the state's K-12 schools, taking into consideration the physical and mental health of students, and determine which findings and recommendations from the previous report have not been remediated or achieved, according to the governor's executive order. The commission also must identify any new recommendations on best practices regarding school safety that have developed since the commission's 2018 report and submit a report and recommendations to the governor by Aug. 1. Subsequent reports will be submitted by the commission's chair. The commission's final report and recommendations will be submitted to the governor no later than Oct. 1, at which time the commission's work will conclude. One of the main challenges identified Tuesday was how to pay for new recommendations that are being discussed. "I know something that hangs over the heads of these committee members and, more importantly, the heads of the school administrators is the cost of all these great ideas and recommendations," said Attorney General Leslie Rutledge, who is a member of the committee. "For school administrators, that is their biggest challenge. Particularly when we look at the legal challenges to making sure all of our schools and education is equal." Rutledge suggested that subcommittees and possibly legislators who are keeping up with the commission might look into funding mechanisms and reach out to the state's federal delegation about finding ways to pay for these ideas. "Last week I personally spoke to Sen. [Tom] Cotton about this with regards to the [Department of Justice] cops grant, and rather than have the federal government take money away from our local schools or states because they don't implement the red flag laws, I would rather us see funds be used to provide [school resource officers] in every school district across the country," she said. "Unless we are able to provide some solutions on how they can implement these recommendations, it's very difficult for our school administrators to even consider adding new expenses." May agreed the cost of these recommendations will need to be examined. "I think that when we go to make a recommendation that it's critically important that we understand the cost of that recommendation," she said. May said she is reviewing a variety of funding options to see if they can be applied. "Once we have a chance to look at these documents, that might help some," she said. "We may be able to pull this together, and as an appendix or addendum to the commission report be able to add this so that they can know that there is that funding available." Multiple members spoke about the importance of schools knowing what is available when it comes to training and how to coordinate a response with local emergency response agencies. "Communication [with the schools] in general is important," May said. "Whether it be with what the commission is doing, or whether it be with their local law enforcement, their fire department, their Office of Emergency Management and even as Dr. [Laura] Dunn said, the parents. "It's critically important schools re-ensure everybody that they are doing everything they possibly can to make their schools as safe as possible." May said reinstatement of the commission also allows members to clearly define some of the terms of their recommendations. "There were things that as a commission last time we thought everybody understood what we were talking about, but not everybody did," she said. Enforcement of the recommendations is another challenge. "We need to determine a way that these school boards and administrators are truly reading and understanding the recommendations," May said. Chief Chris Chapmond of the Hot Springs Police Department told committee members there needs to be a way to determine whether school board members and administrators are reading the recommendations. "Whether that is mandate or however you have that conversation, there is no use in us writing these recommendations unless they are read, understood and followed," Chapmond said Bill Hollenbeck, chief of police for Fort Smith Public Schools, agreed. "All the hard work this committee is doing and has done in the past is frankly for naught unless we get it in front of the right eyes," Hollenbeck said. "We have to get buy-in with our school boards, with our superintendents, with our staff and with our law enforcement agencies or the work that we do will be compiled into a little booklet and potentially put on a shelf. "I think it's important we have some sort of certainty that the right people are looking at this hard work you all are doing." May said in the past the commission has discussed mandates for schools, but there must be a middle ground. She noted that Texas is very strict regarding its school safety mandates but that hasn't prevented school shootings from occurring. "I think there has to be a balance between allowing schools to be able to implement and look at these and promoting what we do," she said. "None of us want our work to go down the drain, and yet at the same time when you start to mandate it I think that opens up a huge chasm of potential things we have to think about." May told subcommittee members their immediate task is to try to identify questions for potentially another school safety assessment. "I don't think we need to do the same survey we did before," she said. "We should try to identify what these questions are and why we ask those questions."

        Prosecutors can't prove a Jacksonville man murdered his infant son, the 26-year-old defendant's lawyer told a Pulaski County jury on Tuesday, describing the baby's death as accidental or, at worst, negligent. Kevonce Lamont Ephriam is charged with capital murder and faces a life sentence. Attorney Jimmy Morris said in opening statements that prosecutors lack evidence to show Ephriam deliberately killed the 3-month-old boy, Kassius "Kash" Ephriam, in February 2020 at Ephriam's Darryl Court home. Ephriam's trial, scheduled to resume at 9 a.m. today, is expected to run until Thursday. Morris urged jurors to pay close attention to the testimony and evidence, saying none of it would live up to prosecution claims Ephriam had intentionally killed the baby. In turn, deputy prosecutor Beth Kanopsic told the 10-woman, two-man jury seated before Circuit Judge Karen Whatley that Kassius was subjected to a bone-breaking, skin-scraping ordeal in which he was "forcibly and violently smothered" in a crushing attack that broke the 12-pound infant's back. Doctors agree a baby that young could not have inflicted the injuries himself, she said. The baby's mother had dropped Kassius off healthy and happy at his father's three days before he died, and Ephriam admits he was the only other person with the infant in the last hours of his life, the prosecutor said. Further, Ephriam had quarreled with the baby's mother the night before, in part because she owed him $20 and couldn't immediately repay it, Kanopsic said. He'd threatened both mother and child the night before the baby was found dead at Ephriam's home, she said. Police called to the Ephriam home found the baby without a pulse but with his body still warm enough that they hoped firefighters could revive him, according to Logan Kulesa, the first officer on the scene. He said he found Ephriam performing two-finger chest compressions on the bloody nosed baby, telling jurors he sent the man away to take over resuscitation efforts because he didn't think Ephriam was trying hard enough. "Not aggressively at all," Kulesa told jurors when asked to describe Ephriam's efforts. "The best way I could describe it was very light." Kassius' mother testified the baby had just gotten over a minor cold two days before she took him to stay with his father, telling jurors Ephriam regularly cared for the boy at his home. Undrea Nicole Brown, a mother of three sons, said the baby, her youngest child, was a happy baby who barely cried. Kassius had been with Ephriam for three days before he died. Brown told jurors she and Ephriam had argued the night before in phone calls and text messages because Ephriam had given her $20 when she dropped off Kassius and wanted her to repay him when she picked up the baby. Brown, 28, said she didn't have the money and was struggling to find someone to drive her to Ephriam's home to pick up the baby. "He was upset because he said he had to go to work and I didn't have a legit ride,"she said. She said she could have gotten a lift from a male friend that night to retrieve the baby but Ephriam told her not to bring a strange man to his house to collect his child. He also told her he would not give up the baby until she gave him the money, Brown told jurors. She said that if he didn't give her the child when she got there, she would "put the police in his life" in one text message. Brown said Ephriam indicated he might hurt the child when she asked him if he would do something to the child but struggled to explain how she came to ask that question beyond saying the two were "just arguing." "When I asked him if he was going to hurt my baby, he said, 'I might,'" she testified. "I really didn't have a reason to ask." On cross-examination, Brown said the pair never lived together and had a provocative relationship, regularly digging at each other to get a reaction. Brown said she didn't take Ephriam's threats against her and Kassius seriously because he regularly talked to her like that. Brown said the only noticeable marks on the baby's body that last time she saw him were a patch of dried skin on his nose, a mostly healed scratch on one cheek caused by him scratching himself and a bowel-surgery scar on his abdomen from when he was less than a month old. Dr. Jennifer Forsyth, the state medical examiner who performed the autopsy on the baby, documented numerous scrapes, cuts and bruises to the baby's head, face, neck and torso, some of them visible with others found under the skin, including near his heart and on his tongue. She also noted that the boy's philtrum -- the cleft above the upper lip -- had been torn. She said Kassius also suffered from fractured ribs and a fractured vertebrae in the middle of his back, acknowledging that some of his injuries could have been caused by resuscitation efforts.

        Police photos of the remains of a former Clinton White House insider, presumed to have killed himself, will be withheld from the public unless someone can come up with a good reason why the photos should be revealed, Pulaski County Circuit Judge Alice Gray has ruled. The four-page order, released Tuesday, comes at the request of the wife and brother of 59-year-old Mark Middleton whose May 7 death in Perry County drew the attention of some news media and conspiracy theorists. Rhea Middleton and Larry Middleton sued to block release of the pictures, complaining they have been harassed by inquiries, fearing disclosure would result in the pictures being published. The judge ruled the privacy interests of the family outweigh any public interest in disclosing the pictures. "The Court finds that since Mr. Middleton's death, the Middletons have been harassed by individuals with outlandish, hurtful, unsubstantiated, and offensive conspiracy theories regarding Mr. Middleton, his death, and his family, which have caused the Middletons immense harm and anguish," Gray's order states. The ruling has a provision that requires anyone who wants to see the pictures to petition the court to show why making the photos public would benefit the public. "Specifically, no citizen of Arkansas has established a public interest that would be advanced by disclosure of the [photos] and, thus, no citizen of Arkansas has shown how disclosure ... would advance any public interest," the ruling states. "Additionally, because unwarranted release of the [pictures] would cause the Middletons to suffer embarrassment and harassment, the Court finds they are likely to suffer irreparable injury. As the United States Supreme Court noted, once the Media Content is released to the public, it belongs to the public, and there is no avenue to repair the full harm the Middletons would suffer upon its disclosure." In a letter to the judge from its attorney John Tull, the Arkansas Press Association endorsed the ruling as "appropriate" balance between the public interest in the investigation into Middleton's death and the privacy interests of the family as recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court, given that the ruling does not prevent the disclosure of the official findings of the investigation, and allows for interested parties to petition the court to obtain access to the photos. Middleton's relatives say they accept the preliminary conclusion that Middleton killed himself, stating Middleton was being treated for depression and they feared at the time he might harm himself. Perry County Sheriff Scott Montgomery said the death appears to be suicide, but a formal conclusion is likely weeks away because of evidence testing. Without the judge's order, the pictures could have been subject to the Arkansas Freedom of Information Act at the official conclusion of the investigation. A close friend of Bill Clinton, Middleton was a senior aide during Clinton's administration, working as a special assistant to the president and an assistant to the president's chief of staff. Middleton, a lawyer, went on to be president of the investment firm MidCorp Capital and managing director of Middleton Heat and Air, which was founded by his father. Middleton's fundraising efforts for Clinton came under Congressional scrutiny, and his access to the White House was restricted after he left to work in the private sector and apparently tried to maintain the appearance of a connection to the White House to impress business clients, according to media reports in the 1990s.

        A Hot Springs man who pleaded guilty in December to one count of attempted production of child pornography berated a federal prosecutor Tuesday during a nearly hour-long statement prior to being sentenced to 15 years in federal prison, claiming he was ignored in efforts to help authorities prosecute other crimes. Jonathan Williams, 42, a former high school counselor from Malvern, pleaded guilty in December before U.S. District Judge Brian Miller after he was snared in an FBI sting operation in 2019. According to court documents, an FBI undercover agent posted an online advertisement titled "Looking for like-minded family fun-no limits," on July 24, 2019, that was answered that same day by a user on the social network and online dating app "Grindr," with a username which was traced back to Williams. At his sentencing hearing Tuesday, Williams alternately suggested he should be hired by the U.S. Department of Justice as an investigator after providing information regarding crimes committed by other inmates during more than two years of pre-trial detention at the Miller County jail and accused Assistant U.S. Attorney Kristin Bryant of ignoring the information he provided and asking for a more severe sentence than what should have been called for under sentencing statutes. Miller told Williams that if he were to provide substantial assistance regarding a conspiracy in which he had involvement, that could result in a lighter sentence were he to cut a deal with prosecutors for that information and the information result in successful prosecutions of co-conspirators. However, he said, because Williams acted alone in the crime he pleaded guilty to, there were no co-conspirators for which he could provide information. "This here is a little different," Miller said. "Here, you're saying 'I'm seeing this in the county jail where I am, and this activity isn't connected to the crime I committed.'" Williams said he had offered to assist the FBI by going on the dark web to track down a child pornography site he said he had stumbled across, but that he had never heard back from the FBI or the U.S. Attorney's office regarding his offer. Bryant said she had not received any information from Williams that proved to be actionable during the time he had been jailed in Miller County. "At this point I'm unaware of any information Mr. Williams has given us that would constitute substantial assistance," she said. "We're not going to give Mr. Williams a computer and let him go on the dark web." As Williams read a rambling, prepared statement that ran 54 minutes in length before he was stopped by Miller, he said when he was first approached by the FBI he thought he was being asked to provide assistance in a child pornography investigation because of his computer expertise. He said it was only later that he realized he was the target of the investigation. He described his online activities on the social media site Grindr as fantasy role-play with other consenting adults in which they would engage in what he called "age play," where a younger man would pretend to be the underage son of an older man for fantasy incest role-playing. While in jail in Miller County, Williams said, he befriended a number of inmates, some of whom he counseled, others he said he helped educate, and others who he said confessed crimes to him that he said he reported to the U.S. Attorney's office. "If this isn't enough to sway Ms. Bryant to offer leniency in some form," he said, "what must one do?" Reading from the statement, Williams claimed to have risked his own personal safety to assist the government in hopes of receiving a lighter sentence. "Instead of a thank you I got punched in the face by a gang member and I have been subjected to lies circulating throughout the facility that I raped and murdered three toddlers," he said. "I spent four months locked down in isolation for 24 hours a day with no outside communication in a cell with a rapist and a murderer, all because I tried to help Ms. Bryant convict another sex offender." Williams said instead of being prosecuted, he should be considered for a job with the Department of Justice. He said he would be willing to go anywhere in the country that Justice officials might wish to send him to investigate sex crimes against children, using his computer skills and other talents to assist in investigations. "To prove that I am no danger to society, let me serve the Department of Justice in an official role," he said. "... I accept total responsibility for my actions, but the punishment should fit the crime." At one point, as he was reading through his statement, Williams grew angry when he saw Bryant lean over and talk to Assistant U.S. Attorney John Ray White. "I'm sorry, Ms. Bryant," he said. "Ms. Bryant, is my statement not important to you?" "She has the right to talk to counsel," Miller interjected. "You've been going on for 40 minutes." When Williams resumed, Bryant objected, saying he was going beyond the sentencing factors in the U.S. sentencing statutes and was making a legal argument. "I am talking about sentencing disparities," Williams broke in, indignantly, "and that is one of the [sentencing] factors." He then complained that his offense of "attempting to produce nude photographs of a non-existent child" had resulted in a statutory minimum sentence of 15 years, saying had he actually raped a child he would face only five years in prison. "Why does Ms. Bryant insist on 15 years when I produced zero pictures of a real child?" he asked. "That's 10 more years than a child rapist." Finally, after 54 minutes, Miller stopped Williams. "How much more do you have?" he asked. "I want you to have your say, but you're getting into legal argument." Williams concluded by saying he should have been prosecuted under a different statute that would have resulted in a substantially lower sentencing range, an argument Miller turned aside, explaining how the sentencing statutes called for a 15-year minimum sentence. "Mr. Williams disagrees, but I have to go by the law," Miller said, then explained that despite the information Williams said he had provided to prosecutors about other inmates' actions, that information had not produced any results that Bryant could take to a grand jury. "She's not in a position to jump up here and say, 'I make a motion,'" Miller said. After sentencing Williams to 15 years, Miller agreed to recommend that he serve his time at a minimum-security prison, at the request of Williams' attorney, Tyler C.M. Tapp III of Hot Springs. "Based off of his personality," Tapp said, "if he goes somewhere like West Memphis, he won't make it 15 years."  Print Headline: Ex-counselor sentenced for child porn

        The Arkansas Department of Human Services on Tuesday announced plans for a new program to help people who are caring for individuals with Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia. The $200,000 Dementia Respite Care Pilot Program aims to help the more than 93,000 caregivers across the state. Individuals can apply for a $500 grant up to twice a year, with six months between each attempt. Unlike other grants, this program is not based on income. "These funds can be used to pay someone that the caregiver or family knows personally," said Amanda Shaw, Grant Coordinator for Alzheimer's Arkansas. "It must be someone over the age of 18 that does not live in the home. Or, they can use the funds to pay for a professional caregiver to come into the home. They can also utilize an adult daycare facility. It's up to the family to decide which option works best for them." The announcement comes after the Arkansas Legislative Council approved the launch of the program on Friday. State Rep. Julie Mayberry, R-Hensley, said that she believes these caregivers deserve time to "stop and smell the roses." David Cook with the Arkansas Chapter of the Alzheimers Association noted that the services of these caregivers often go unpaid and that these individuals provided over 140 million hours of care in 2021. Cook added that the efforts made by these individuals have saved the state an estimated $3 billion annually. Both Alzheimer's Arkansas and Alzheimer's Association have partnered with the Department of Human Services to launch the respite grant and its services. Cook described the announcement as "a historic day in Arkansas" and called it "the first program of its kind." The newly established program will allow the state to collect data on where services are needed most. Portions of the program will involve "targeted funding" -- which will allow the state to better serve caregivers in more rural areas, according to Cook. Carolyn Berry, executive director of Alzheimer's Arkansas, acknowledged the state's ongoing struggle with accessibility. "Accessibility has always been an issue. We want to make sure we serve caregivers across the entire state. We will partner together and make sure that our caregivers have the respite care needed," said Berry. Although this is the first grant of its kind, the state Department of Human Services and its partners reiterated that plans for better serving these individuals extend far beyond the new program. Mayberry added that this is only the beginning of the support and funding the state would like to provide to these caregivers. "This is just a stepping stone. One that we will celebrate ... but we're not going to stop here. We have a lot of enthusiasm and we plan to improve it even more," Mayberry said. Applications are not yet available, but an official launch date for the program will be announced. More information on the program and its services can be found at ALZark.org/grants.

         A group representing non-licensed staff in the North Little Rock School District voted to approve a plan to update the district's security apparatus Monday. The plan will go to the North Little Rock School Board for a vote Thursday for final approval. Superintendent Gregory Pilewski has proposed a plan to reorganize the district security through the addition of armed guards, new managers and more training for security staff. Pilewski's plan will also reorganize a number of security positions in the district, meaning many working security positions in the school district will have to apply to keep their jobs after their contracts end in June 2023. The plan calls for 11 armed and 27 unarmed security officers to be posted at schools around the district. The security guards will undergo state certification, Pilewski said. The Classified Personnel Policy Committee, which represents non-licensed staff members, voted unanimously to back Pilewski's plan. "The report was very thorough in how they explained it to us," said Adrienne Durham, co-chair of the district's Classified Personnel Policy Committee. "And I think it was much needed for this district." Hayward Finks, former assistant chief with the Little Rock Police Department, has led the effort to beef up security in the district saying staff need to be better trained to handle crises and take better advantage of already in place school technology. "Right now, as I conducted the assessment, there are a lot of staff and security personnel that are not absolutely certain what needs to happen in a crisis situation," Finks told the board of education during a meeting last week. The plan comes as schools around the country reconsider their security in the wake of the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas. There have also been incidents near the district. In October, a teen was shot across the street from North Little Rock High School while attempting to buy a gun, sending the school into a lockdown.

         Parks and Recreation workers in Little Rock's Riverfront Park on Tuesday found a bronze sculpture of a saxophonist that was stolen from its pedestal in the park's sculpture garden, according to a city news release. The sculpture, called "Jazz Player", was one of two removed from their pedestal sometime last week, although it was unclear if the perpetrator's intent was to take the metals or simply vandalize the statues. The other statue, which shared a pedestal with "Jazz Player" and another sculpture, was found nearby the park Friday. City spokesperson Spencer Watson could not say how far away from the pedestal "Jazz Player" was when it was rediscovered Tuesday, but he said he would try to get that information. He declined to speculate on whether the perpetrator was after the metals in the sculpture or merely intent on causing vandalism. Police are investigating the theft, but have yet to name any suspects.  Print Headline: ‘Jazz Player, other lost sculptures discovered

        A North Little Rock teenager will be charged as an adult after police said he shot two people Monday night, according to a news release and arrest records. Officers arrived about 9 p.m. at 23 Neal Place in North Little Rock after getting a report that two people had been shot. One person was treated at the scene for minor injuries, while the other was taken to an area hospital with potentially life-threatening injuries, according to a North Little Rock Police Department news release. The release did not identify a suspect, but an arrest report stated police arrested 16-year-old Mi'Angelo Davis after the victims identified him and said they'd had conflicts with Davis in the past. Police reported that Davis was sweating and nervous when they spoke with him before the arrest, and that he made several statements implicating himself in the crime. Davis was read his Miranda rights and told police in an interview that he was armed and confronting the two victims in a dispute involving his stepbrother, the arrest report states. Davis thought one of the victims had a rifle, but he did not see one, according to police. Davis told officers the two victims followed him back to the street and he shot at them, thinking they would attack him, according to the report. The report states that Davis' statement about the incident changed several times. Davis is charged with two counts of felony first-degree battery.

         100 years ago June 22, 1922 ODESSA--The price of diamonds is soaring so rapidly here and in Moscow that German jewelers, who spent huge sums buying up collections from the impoverished Russian nobility are now back in Russia selling their wares at double the prices they asked in Germany. The diamond market owes its rise to the scramble of traders and merchants to get rid of their rubles. Never sure of the value paper money will have from day to day, they literally invent bales of Soviet currncy in precious stones. 50 years ago June 22, 1972 ARKADELPHIA--Twenty-two students made all A's during the spring semester at Ouachita Baptist University. They were: Beverly Beadle, Suella Beard, and Roberta Gay Gladden, all of Little Rock; Judith Ann Crouch of North Little Rock; Shirley Grant, Jamie Hobgood, James D. Hurley, Sharon Kluck, and Mary Kaye Sandford, all of Arkadelphia; Patricia Greene of Malvern; Rita Guthrie of Smithville; Sammie Carol Halbert of Star City; Bernie Hargis of Warren; John Holston of Texarkana; Deborah L.

Freeman of Sheridan, Miss White River, will represent Arkansas in the Miss America Pageant in September in Atlantic City, N.J. She was crowned by Melonie McGarrah, Miss Arkansas 1996, before a cheering throng at the Hot Springs Convention Auditorium Saturday night. Freeman, 21, is a graduate in dance from Oklahoma City University. She wins $46,000 in awards and prizes plus a $12,000 scholarship. Chrisna George, Miss Little Rock, was first runner-up and won a $7,000 scholarship. 10 years ago June 22, 2012 Fire investigators said the June 11 Little Rock apartment building fire that displaced 200 residents, injured five and killed one was caused by someone smoking in bed. Little Rock Fire Department spokesman Capt. Randy Hickmon said Vertis Brown, 72, was likely smoking in bed, which appeared to be the point of origin in the Plaza Towers blaze that ultimately claimed her life. "The bed is where the fire started, and she's been known to smoke in bed," Hickmon said. "The bed and the related items around the bed are the most highly flammable materials, it didn't take long [for the fire] to get going." Fire officials said the blaze started about 8 p.m. and that the woman's second-floor apartment was in flames by the time fire crews arrived. The fire damaged adjoining apartments and caused substantial smoke damage throughout the lower floors.  Print Headline: Other days

        A White County man indicted as part of a wide-ranging drug conspiracy following a large-scale drug bust in north-central Arkansas last year faces a possible maximum sentence of 20 years in prison after pleading guilty Tuesday in federal court to one count of possession of methamphetamine with intent to deliver. Sigmond Donelson, 48, of Searcy, entered his plea before U.S. District Judge Lee Rudofsky in the drug conspiracy case in White County that stemmed from a federal investigation that resulted in indictments of 33 people. The investigation, dubbed Operation "Central Sweep," began in April 2020 as a push for Searcy police to combat growing violent crime connected to a drug distribution organization known as the "Gangster Disciples" near Searcy, Police Chief Steve Hernandez said last year following announcement of the arrests. Numerous indictments were handed up by a federal grand jury in Little Rock on March 5, 2021, with many of the suspects rounded up about a week later around the county and taken to a staging area at the Searcy Municipal Airport prior to their court appearances. Donelson, who was indicted along with Keith Williams, 48, of Augusta, has been free on pre-trial release with conditions since his arraignment after U.S. Magistrate Judge Joe Volpe allowed him to leave detention to live with his mother in Memphis where he had a job lined up. After testing positive for drug use, Donelson was allowed to enter residential drug rehabilitation treatment followed by chemical-free living as an alternative to revocation of his release, assistant U.S. Attorney Amanda Fields said. U.S. District Judge Lee Rudofsky outlined Donelson's options to plead innocent, guilty or no contest and went over Donelson's rights should he elect to go to trial and the rights he would surrender by pleading guilty. He told Donelson "a plea of guilty in open court is the strongest proof under the law," and could be withdrawn later only under the most extreme circumstances. Reading the terms of the plea agreement worked out between the government and Donelson under the guidance of his attorney, Crystal Okoro of North Little Rock, Fields said Donelson had agreed the charge involved just less than 13 grams of methamphetamine. Fields said that on Aug. 3, 2020, Donelson was driving a vehicle that Searcy police pulled over for expired tags and was arrested after police smelled marijuana and discovered outstanding arrest warrants for Donelson and for Williams, who she said was a passenger in the vehicle.. She said after Donelson and Williams were arrested a search of the vehicle turned up the methamphetamine, a quantity of marijuana and a set of scales. "Initially," Fields said, "Donelson denied that the methamphetamine belonged to him but later acknowledged that his fingerprints would likely be found on the plastic bag containing the methamphetamine." Following up, Rudofsky asked Donelson if he admitted that he possessed the methamphetamine and that his intention was to distribute the drug, to which Donelson answered affirmatively to both questions. After accepting Donelson's plea, Rudofsky allowed him to remain free on pre-trial release conditions and to continue his stay in chemical-free living after Fields said he had had no further positive drug tests after completing rehab. Okoro noted that Donelson was working at a steady job and helping to support his family while he awaited resolution of his case. "The only reason I'm doing this is because you seem to have turned around the problem you had originally while you were on pre-trial supervision," Rudofsky told Donelson. "If I find there are any problems ... I'm going to issue a warrant for you and put you in jail pending sentencing."  Print Headline: Man pleads guilty to 1 count in drug case with 33 indicted

         Temperatures in parts of Arkansas are expected to reach triple digits by the end of this week, according to forecasters from the National Weather Service in North Little Rock. Colby Pope, a meteorologist with the weather service, said it is fairly likely that by Saturday Little Rock, Hot Springs and Pine Bluff could see temperatures at or over 100. There is a possibility that the northern counties of the state could see some isolated rain on Thursday, but the next chance at cooling down a bit for the rest of Arkansas is Sunday going into Monday with a chance of isolated thunderstorms. "It's looking likely, it just won't be a widespread event," said Pope, "And it's not going to last." This summer is starting off warmer than previous years and the trends show it to be dryer, according to Pope. "In Little Rock, around this time in previous years, the high was 90 degrees," said Pope, "So we are starting off already almost 10 degrees hotter than normal." Pope said the dry heat is less likely to cause heat related illnesses, but should still be monitored. Cooling centers or shelters are starting to pop up around the state in order to combat the persistent heat. A cooling center in North Little Rock opened Tuesday morning and will stay open until Sunday evening to allow residents to get relief from the heat. It's located at the North Little Rock Community Center at 2700 Willow St. and it will be open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. each day. According to a news release, pets are allowed and there will be vending machines in the area. North Little Rock police officer Jhailan Rathey, a liaison to the unsheltered community, said the cooling center will be open to the public with no identification required. "Right now we can fit about 30 to 40 people," Rathey said. According to Rathey, masks and free water will be available to those in the center. He said the reason North Little Rock decided to open a cooling center now was due to forecasted high temperatures near 100 degrees. The East Little Rock Community Center at 2500 E. 6th St., will be open noon to 6 p.m. Tuesday through Friday. Pets are not allowed in the cooling center due to the community center policy, City of Little Rock spokesman Spencer Watson said Tuesday. Beyond battling the temperature, Pope said Arkansans should be mindful about air quality. Arkansas' Department of Energy and Environment issued an air quality advisory "code orange" for ozone for central parts of the state in a news release Tuesday. High ozone concentrations could possibly irritate the eyes, nose, throats and lungs of individuals outside and puts those with respiratory illnesses at a higher risk of being affected. According to Donnally Davis, a spokesperson for the agency, this is the second ozone advisory this year. "The advisory is due to a combination of several meteorological factors that are conducive for high ozone concentrations, such as: hot temperatures, light winds, abundance of sunshine, low relative-humidity, and a high pressure system over Arkansas," wrote Davis in an email on Tuesday. Energy bills are also likely to rise as heat and air quality make going outside less viable options for Arkansans. Brandi Hinkle, a spokesperson for Entergy, said the company offers levelized billing, deferred payment and other programs to help pay higher bills. Hinkle said air conditioning and heating costs make up almost 50% to 55% of electricity costs on a monthly bill. "Every degree warmer a customer leaves their air conditioning on in the summer is 3% off their bill," she said Tuesday. Entergy is not worried about blackouts, according to Hinkle, as she says the state makes most of its energy. "We feel confident we will have enough energy to support Arkansas," she said, "But we encourage customers to actively monitor their usage so they aren't surprised by the bill." Benton Utilities, however, said in a news release it received a capacity advisory from the company that operates the bulk electric transmission grid that delivers power to the state. Any time during extreme temperatures, the utility company may be asked to reduce the amount of electricity it is pulling from the grid. "Benton Utilities relies on an out of town supply," said Darren Prysock, the electric department manager from the company, "We would ask our customers to turn off their lights or increase the temperature of their air conditioning. We haven't asked anyone yet, this message is just kind of a forewarning." Prysock said if customers are not complying, the company could have to plan outages. This excludes entities like hospitals and emergency buildings.  Print Headline: Arkansas prepares for triple digit heat, high ozone load

"As an alumna of Envision myself, I am excited for Ajaiah to meet, work, and collaborate with other high-aspiring students from across the country and the globe," said Amanda Freitag Thomas, senior vice president for Envision. "Hands down, my favorite part of attending an Envision program was being with motivated students in an environment designed to help us challenge our assumptions, meet new people, and grow. Creating that same learning environment is a central focus for all of our programs. At NYLF Security, students build the confidence and skills needed to excel at college and in the workplace. They learn how to adapt to and communicate in new situations, to new challenges, and with new people, which, given how rapidly the world is changing due to technology and innovation, are essential skills for success."

        FAYETTEVILLE -- Theft of property charges against Ray Dotson, a former Springdale alderman, were dropped earlier this year after he allowed a former tenant of his recreational vehicle park to retrieve her property. Dotson, 62, of 3900 Shorts Lane in Springdale, was arrested after he refused to allow a woman to retrieve several vehicles from the Rivers Edge RV Park at 20751 Blue Springs Road, which is about 4 miles east of Springdale off U.S. 412. Dotson said he was owed rent. Dotson was charged Jan. 5; the charges were dropped May 3. Dotson had earlier been assigned a court date today. Deputy prosecutor Denis Dean said the agreement worked out between the state and the defense was Dotson agreed to return the seized property and the woman was satisfied justice was served and agreed the criminal case should be dropped. Dean said he didn't know whether any back rent was paid. A Washington County deputy was sent to the RV park Sept. 24 after two 911 calls were received, according to an affidavit for an arrest warrant. One call, made by Dotson, was about a trespassing in progress. The second call was made by Catina Pickle, who said Dotson was "irate and aggressive" when she entered the RV park to obtain her and her deceased husband's property. Pickle said some of the property was in her name and some was in her husband's name. Pickle told the deputy her husband died Sept. 20. Dotson told the deputy Pickle needed to pay rent he was owed, and he wouldn't allow her to remove the property until the debt was paid, according to the affidavit. Dotson told the deputy the RV park was private property and "an impound yard" and he could put a lien on the property himself if the rent wasn't paid. Dotson hadn't obtained a court order authorizing a lien on the property and continued to refuse to allow Pickle to retrieve the property, according to the affidavit. The affidavit said Dotson moved some of the property to a storage facility and refused to tell Pickle its location. The property included a camper valued at $4,500, a boat valued at $3,000, a Ford Bronco valued at $2,000 and a Ford pickup valued at $1,000. Dotson was charged with theft of property, according to information filed in Washington County Circuit Court. Under Arkansas law, theft of property is a Class C felony when the property is valued at more than $5,000 but less than $25,000. Dotson served on Springdale's City Council from 1992 to 1994 and from 2004 to 2008. He was defeated in a bid for a council seat in 2018.  Print Headline: Charges against Dotson dropped

        ROGERS -- The School Board on Tuesday approved several changes in administrative positions, including a new head of the district's virtual learning program. Matthew Cook, principal of the district's Crossroads alternative learning program the past three years, will take over direction of the Rogers Virtual Learning program for grades 6-12, said Roger Hill, assistant superintendent for human resources. Cook replaces Darla Tomasko, who's retiring. Before joining the district in 2019, Cook was principal of Sugar Creek Elementary School in Bentonville for five years and served concurrently as director of Bentonville's elementary alternative learning academy. Before that he was a principal in Huntsville for two years. He has a master's degree in educational leadership from Harding University, according to a district news release. Martin Resendiz will take Cook's place as Crossroads principal, moving from his role as assistant principal at Heritage High School, which he's held for two years. He has a master's degree in school counseling from the University of Central Arkansas and completed a K-12 building level principal program of study at Harding University. In turn, Milton Martinez will assume Resendiz's old position, transferring from student success coordinator at New Technology High School to assistant principal at Heritage, Hill said. Martinez began his teaching career at New Technology in 2016 and was a Spanish teacher for five years. The board also approved hiring Stephanie Taylor as the assistant principal at Darr Elementary School. Taylor has eight years of teaching experience, most recently as an alternative learning environment teacher in Bentonville. She has a master's degree in educational administration from Missouri Southern State University; she also completed a specialist program in educational leadership at the University of Arkansas, according to the release.

        Parks and Recreation workers in Little Rock's Riverfront Park on Tuesday found a bronze sculpture of a saxophonist that was stolen from its pedestal in the park's sculpture garden and thought lost, according to a city news release. The sculpture, called "Jazz Player," was one of two removed from their pedestal sometime last week, although it was unclear if the perpetrator's intent was to take the metals or simply vandalize the statues. The other statue, which shared a pedestal with "Jazz Player" and another sculpture, was found nearby by parks workers Friday. City spokesman Spencer Watson could not say how far away from the pedestal "Jazz Player" was when it was rediscovered Tuesday, but said he would try to get that information. He declined to speculate on whether the perpetrator was after the metals in the sculpture or merely intent on causing vandalism. Police are investigating the theft, but have yet to name any suspects.

        Temperatures in parts of Arkansas are expected to reach triple digits by the end of this week, according to forecasters from the National Weather Service in North Little Rock.  Colby Pope, a meteorologist with the weather service, said it is fairly likely that by Saturday Little Rock, Hot Springs and Pine Bluff could see temperatures at or over 100.  There is a possibility that the northern counties of the state could see some isolated rain on Thursday, but the next chance at cooling down a bit for the rest of Arkansas is Sunday going into Monday with a chance of isolated thunderstorms. “Its looking likely, it just wont be a widespread event,” said Pope, “And it's not going to last.”  This summer is starting off warmer than previous years and the trends show it to be dryer, according to Pope.  “In Little Rock, around this time in previous years, the high was 90 degrees,” said Pope, “So we are starting off already almost 10 degrees hotter than normal.” Pope said the dry heat is less likely to cause heat related illnesses, but should still be monitored.  Cooling centers or shelters are starting to pop up around the state in order to combat the persistent heat.  A cooling center in North Little Rock opened Tuesday morning and will stay open until Sunday evening to allow residents to get relief from the heat.  It's located at the North Little Rock Community Center at 2700 Willow St. and it will be open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. each day.  According to a news release, pets are allowed and there will be vending machines in the area.   North Little Rock police officer Jhailan Rathey, a liaison to the unsheltered community, said the cooling center will be open to the public with no identification required.  “Right now we can fit about 30 to 40 people,” Rathey said.  According to Rathey, masks and free water will be available to those in the center. He said the reason North Little Rock decided to open a cooling center now was due to forecasted high temperatures near 100 degrees.   The East Little Rock Community Center at 2500 E. 6th St., will be open noon to 6 p.m. Tuesday through Friday. Pets are not allowed in the cooling center due to the community center policy, City of Little Rock spokesman Spencer Watson said Tuesday.  [RELATED: Cooling shelter locations being sought in Hot Springs » arkansasonline.com/621hscooling/] Beyond battling the temperature, Pope said Arkansans should be mindful about air quality.  Arkansas' Department of Energy and Environment issued an air quality advisory "code orange" for ozone for central parts of the state in a news release Tuesday. High ozone concentrations could possibly irritate the eyes, nose, throats and lungs of individuals outside and puts those with respiratory illnesses at a higher risk of being affected.  According to Donnally Davis, a spokesperson for the agency, this is the second ozone advisory this year.  “The advisory is due to a combination of several meteorological factors that are conducive for high ozone concentrations, such as: hot temperatures, light winds, abundance of sunshine, low relative-humidity, and a high pressure system over Arkansas,” wrote Davis in an email on Tuesday.  Energy bills are also likely to rise as heat and air quality make going outside less viable options for Arkansans.  Brandi Hinkle, a spokesperson for Entergy, said the company offers levelized billing, deferred payment and other programs to help pay higher bills. Hinkle said air conditioning and heating costs make up almost 50% to 55% of electricity costs on a monthly bill. “Every degree warmer a customer leaves their air conditioning on in the summer is 3% off their bill,” she said Tuesday.  Entergy is not worried about blackouts, according to Hinkle, as she says the state makes most of its energy.   “We feel confident we will have enough energy to support Arkansas,” she said, “But we encourage customers to actively monitor their usage so they arent surprised by the bill.” Benton Utilities, however, said in a news release it received a capacity advisory from the company that operates the bulk electric transmission grid that delivers power to the state.  Any time during extreme temperatures, the utility company may be asked to reduce the amount of electricity it is pulling from the grid.  “Benton Utilities relies on an out of town supply,” said Darren Prysock, the electric department manager from the company, “We would ask our customers to turn off their lights or increase the temperature of their air conditioning. We havent asked anyone yet, this message is just kind of a forewarning.”  Prysock said if customers are not complying, the company could have to plan outages. This excludes entities like hospitals and emergency buildings.

        An 18-year-old man was arrested Sunday in relation to a shooting in northern Jonesboro, police said. Shortly after 9 p.m. on Saturday, police were notified that a 21-year-old woman had been shot  in the upper ankle of her right leg, near the intersection of French and Bradley streets, according to a Jonesboro Police Department report.  Sally Smith, a spokesperson for the department, said Tuesday that the woman had been transported to a hospital in Memphis for further surgery to repair her leg but was in stable condition.  Keontaye Droughn was arrested on Sunday in connection with the shooting after surrendering to police, the report states.  According to the report, Droughn and the woman got into an argument that resumed after she got off work and picked up the man and his son. When she drove Droughn to his home, Droughn took his son inside, returned with a weapon and shot at her at least three times, according to the report. The woman told police he took her phone and fled the scene.  Droughn was charged with first-degree domestic battery and theft. He was booked into the Craighead County jail, where he remained Tuesday in lieu of $150,000 bond. Police said the woman accused Droughn of at least one previous act of domestic abuse between them that was not reported at the time.

        As summer officially arrives and temperatures in Arkansas continue to rise late into the week, heat-related illnesses will be a serious concern, especially for the homeless and seniors, raising the possibility that a community cooling shelter in Hot Springs will be needed. "At the end of this week, we're going to have temperatures of 100 degrees. With the humidity, that heat index certainly is going to be somewhere around 105, 107. We're going to have temperatures in the next several weeks even higher than that -- I mean, we're in June," Sally Carder, St. Luke's Episcopal outreach coordinator, said Monday. St. Luke's has long provided warming and cooling shelters for the homeless population of Hot Springs. "We're very concerned because we've put out a notice and actually a request for help for churches and organizations -- anyone that has the space that we can have a cooling shelter," she said. In recent years, homelessness has been on the rise in Hot Springs. "You've got to understand that our homeless population has a lot of different kinds of health problems," Carder said. "They've got asthma, they've got all kinds of heart problems, all kinds of things that play into their health. People will say, 'You know, they're out there all the time, they're used to it.' Nobody is used to living 24 hours a day outside when the heat index is that high. Yes, there are people that work out there ... those people go home to air conditioning."  Video not playing? Click here https://www.youtube.com/embed/1QWTdJhlFRo  Carder said they also have a number of lower-income families and individuals, including older people, that live in homes that don't have air conditioning or don't have electricity. "Those people are very much at risk," she said. "I'm disappointed that we put out a call for churches and different organizations, different places, to let us know if they would allow us to have a cooling shelter there (and) we have no one at all that respond(ed) to an email that we've put out." Carder said she does not know of any other organizations running or planning cooling shelters in Hot Springs. "Right now, our church doesn't have air conditioning. We have people that are in there working on that every day, or certainly we'd step up and do something," she said. Cooperative Christian Ministries and Clinic will be the lead agency for cooling shelters and warming shelters in the future, Carder said. "They're going to take the lead on our shelters. They're the ones who put out an email and a request for help," she said. "When we get an excessive heat warning, a dangerous heat warning, then that's when those shelters would kick into place. We're talking about opening at noon and going until 6 p.m. No meals served, but certainly water and Gatorade ... just a place for people to come and sit and cool off during the hottest part of the day," she said. "We're asking churches, businesses, organizations, anybody that is in an area where there are people who need the help, to put out coolers of water, Gatorade, and keep that ice in there so people can come by ... and get one of those to stay hydrated. That's the least we can do," she said. "This week is going to be hot, but there are going to be some major, major days coming up where the heat is just too much for people," Carder said. "So we're asking, if you have an idea of where we can go. If your facility is -- and it doesn't have to be really large ... but a place that has air conditioning. We can certainly help with the electric bill ... we're just looking for a place for the folks that really need the help."

        Arkansas' first coronavirus vaccine doses for children under 5 began arriving in the state on Monday, and by the end of the day, some parents had been able to get the shots for their kids. Cory Grummer took her 4-year-old daughter, Lane, to Kavanaugh Pharmacy in Little Rock to get the Moderna vaccine after hearing from a friend that the store had it. "They said that she was the first kid under 5 that they had vaccinated," Grummer said. "She didn't bat an eyelash, and they gave her a bunch of candy and she was happy." Dr. Joel Tumlison, the state Department of Health's medical director for immunizations, said 13 of the 23 vaccine shipments that were in the state's initial two orders had arrived by Monday afternoon, and another was expected later Monday. Four more shipments are expected today. The state hadn't received an expected delivery date on the other five shipments, but Tumlison was hopeful they would arrive by the end of the week. "Frankly, it's gotten here faster to many places than we thought it might," he said. The first wave of deliveries, consisting of 15,000 each of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, are going to nine of the Health Department's local health units that will distribute them to other health units as well as private clinics and pharmacies. The second wave, with 3,100 doses of mostly Pfizer vaccine, includes some shipments that will go directly to hospitals and pharmacies. The second wave was initially expected sometime between Thursday and June 29, but some of those shipments are now expected to arrive today, Tumlison said. Through a federal program that ships doses directly to pharmacies, Kavanaugh Pharmacy received 100 doses of the Moderna vaccine on Monday morning, co-owner Anne Pace said. By the afternoon, it had administered the shots to three or four children, she said. "The parents that were getting [their children] vaccinated, they were ready," Pace said. "I think they've been ready for a while, so they were anxious to get it going." State and federal laws don't allow pharmacists to vaccinate children younger than 3, so Grummer wasn't able to get her 1-year-old son vaccinated on Monday. She said she plans to take him to the doctor to get it once the doctor has doses available. Without the protection of the vaccines, she said her youngest children haven't been able to do things like go to friends' indoor birthday parties, visit the Museum of Discovery or eat indoors in restaurants. "We've just been really careful this whole time, and we feel like getting to the point where we can protect the littlest ones in our family its a step closer to the end for us," Grummer said. Lane, who got a Paw Patrol Band-Aid, said the shot wasn't too bad. "It hurt, but I said 'ow' and that's it," she said. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Friday authorized the Pfizer vaccine for children from 6 months to 4 years of age and the Moderna vaccine for ages 6 months to 5 years. Both vaccines are low-dose versions of the companies' shots that are available to adults. Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, on Saturday endorsed an advisory committee's recommendation that all eligible children receive a vaccine. A vaccine hadn't previously been cleared for children under 5. Tumlison said it will probably be late today or Wednesday before many providers start administering doses. To get the vaccine at a local health unit, people should call ahead to make sure the unit has doses available and to make an appointment, although walk-ins are also accepted, Health Department spokeswoman Danyelle McNeill said. Arkansas Children's, which will offer Pfizer vaccine at its primary care clinics around the state, expects to receive its first doses later this week, spokeswoman Hilary DeMillo said. CHI St. Vincent expects to receive its first shipment of vaccine for children younger than 5 "within the next few days," spokeswoman Bonnie Ward said in an emailed statement. "The vaccine will be available through the ministry's pediatric healthcare providers," Ward said. "Parents interested in having their children age five and under receive the vaccine should contact their child's pediatrician to schedule an appointment." Baptist Health plans to offer the vaccine in its clinics "that currently provide other immunizations for children in that age group," spokeswoman Cara Wade said in an email. "As far as timing, we anticipate hearing more about vaccine distribution from the Arkansas Department of Health," she said. She added that the vaccine "continues to be our best defense against COVID-19." "For parents who have questions about getting their children vaccinated, we recommend talking to your pediatrician or primary care provider, who are trusted with other aspects of guidance for your children's health," Wade said. NEW CASES DOWN Meanwhile, possibly reflecting a slowdown in testing and reporting around the federal Juneteenth holiday, Arkansas' count of coronavirus cases rose Monday by 251, the first daily increase in six days that was smaller than the one a week earlier. After rising the previous two days, the number of people hospitalized in the state with covid-19 fell by 15, to 181. For the third time in four days, the state didn't report any new deaths from covid-19. The state's death toll, as tracked by the Arkansas Department of Health, remained at 11,540. The increase in cases was less than half the size of the one a day earlier and smaller by 81 than the daily rise a week earlier. Due to slowdowns in testing and reporting over the weekends, the state's daily case increases tend to be smaller on Sundays and Mondays than during the rest of the week. The Juneteenth holiday on Sunday, which caused some government offices and businesses to be closed on Monday, may have also affected Monday's new case numbers, Tumlison said. Previously at its highest level since February, the average daily increase in Arkansas' case count over a rolling seven-day period fell Monday to 715. Pulaski County had the most new cases, 45, followed by Sebastian County with 25 and Benton County with 20. The state's cumulative count of cases since March 2020 rose to 855,543. With recoveries outnumbering new cases, the number of cases in the state that were considered active fell by 456, to 8,307 -- the first daily decline in two weeks. After not changing the previous three days, the number of the state's virus patients who were on ventilators rose by four, to 13, the largest number since May 4. The number who were in intensive care, which fell by one on Sunday, rose Monday by seven, to 33. It was the first time the number had been above 30 since April 7. At its hospitals in Little Rock and Springdale, Arkansas Children's had a total of seven covid-19 patients on Monday, down from eight as of Friday, DeMillo said.

        Loretta Hendrix, an announced candidate for the Ward 1 seat on the Little Rock Board of Directors, was injured in a shooting Saturday while driving, according to a Little Rock Police Department report. As of Monday afternoon, Hendrix remained at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences hospital after the incident, she said when reached by phone. Hendrix, 73, is the daughter of the late Ward 1 City Director Erma Hendrix, who died in office last September at age 91. About 10 p.m. Saturday, police responded to 1501 Wright Ave. in reference to a shooting that had just occurred and found Hendrix with an apparent gunshot wound to her left leg and femoral bleeding, according to the police report. After police applied two tourniquets to her injured leg, Hendrix was handed off to paramedics for transportation to UAMS, the report said. In the vehicle's front passenger seat at the time of the shooting was Hendrix's sister, Phyllis Brown, 66, police reported. Brown told police the shooting occurred somewhere in the area of West 15th Street and South State Street, or West 15th Street and South Chester Street, the report said. Officers found multiple shell casings in the roadway and around the property of 811 and 813 W. 15th St. The residence at 813 W. 15th St. had been struck by three bullets, and although police attempted to make contact with a homeowner, no one answered the door, according to the report. Additionally, police dispatched to 1312 W. 15th St. in reference to a bullet that struck the residence at the same time as the reported shooting found a bullet that had entered through an east-facing window. Two 88-year-old individuals were inside with a guest at the time of the shooting, but they were unhurt, the report said. Brown's vehicle, a 2008 Honda CR-V, was towed to the crime scene bay for processing, the report said. At the time of the shooting, Hendrix was returning home from a memorial service for a friend when "we just got caught in between crossfire," she said. "You know, I had never experienced anything like that in my neighborhood." There has been an increase in the number of gunshots in the neighborhood starting approximately a year and a half ago after a long period of quiet, she recalled. A detective visited Hendrix in the hospital on Monday, she said, adding that she expected another visit from police before the day was over. Hendrix had surgery early Sunday morning, she said, and anticipated she would leave the hospital today in order to go to another facility for rehabilitation. Contests for six of the seven ward-specific seats on the Little Rock Board of Directors as well as mayor will be on the ballot during the November election. The board's structure also includes three at-large representatives. Candidate packets are currently available from the city. The filing period will run from July 29 until Aug. 19 at noon. In January, Hendrix announced a bid for mayor, but last month changed her mind and said she would instead run for the Ward 1 seat formerly held by her mother. Hendrix and other potential Ward 1 contenders are expected to face City Director Virgil Miller Jr., whom the city board appointed last year to fill the vacancy left by Erma Hendrix's death. Miller has said he intends to seek a full term of his own during the November election. Winners of the municipal contests will be inaugurated for four-year terms that begin Jan. 1, 2023.

        Gov. Asa Hutchinson has appointed Mitch Rouse, chief legal counsel for the state Department of Transformation and Shared Services, as the department's secretary, Hutchinson announced Monday. Besides serving as the department's chief legal counsel, Rouse also has served as director of the Office of State Procurement. He will succeed Amy Fecher as the department's secretary, effective July 1. "Mitch has shown his dedication to Arkansas, and I have full confidence that he will continue to lead the transformation efforts," Hutchinson said Monday in a news release. "He has invaluable experience serving the state and will be a great fit as Secretary of Transformation and Shared Services," said the Republican governor, whose eight-year tenure as governor will end in January. As director of the Office of State Procurement, Rouse oversaw the procurement of commodities and services for the state. As chief counsel at the Department of Transformation and Shared Services, he managed a staff of five attorneys and handled legal matters for all divisions under the Department of Transformation and Shared Services. The department includes the Office of the Secretary, the Arkansas Geographic Information Systems Office, the Division of Building Authority, the Division of Information Systems, the Employee Benefits Division, the Office of Personnel Management and the Office of State Procurement, according to its website. Rouse's salary will be $172,094 as the department's secretary, Hutchinson spokeswoman Shealyn Sowers said Monday. That's the salary level Fecher would have received after a merit raise if she had continued as transformation secretary, she said. Rouse's current salary is $140,189 a year and Fecher's current salary is $167,081, according to the Arkansas Transparency website. Fecher has served as the department's secretary since July 2019. Earlier this month, trustees for the Arkansas Public Employees Retirement System voted to hire Fecher as its executive director, starting July 1. As the system's executive director, Rouse will be paid a starting salary of $165,396 a year -- the same salary paid to former system Executive Director Duncan Baird, who departed in April to take a job at Walmart. The system is state government's second-largest retirement benefit with more than $10 billion in investments and more than 75,000 working and retired members. In the governor's office news release, Rouse said he is honored to be appointed by Hutchinson as the department's secretary. "Hard work has afforded me this opportunity, and I look forward to leading this department with energy and integrity." Before joining the Department of Transformation and Shared Services, Rouse was the chief of staff and associate director of the Office of Air Quality at what was formerly called the Department of Environmental Quality. He also served as a federal law clerk for the Honorable D.P. Marshall Jr. in the Eastern District of Arkansas. He graduated magna cum laude from Arkansas State University, where he received bachelor's degrees in English and philosophy. He received his law degree from the William H. Bowen School of Law at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, where he served as editor-in-chief of the UALR Law Review. The state Department of Transformation and Shared Services is one of the state government's 15 executive branch departments. Hutchinson's reorganization of executive branch agencies cut their ranks from 42 to 15, starting in July 2019, under Act 910. Hutchinson's reorganization in 2019 represented the most sweeping overhaul of state government since 1971 when then-Gov. Dale Bumpers, a Democrat, led an initiative to meld 60 agencies into 13 departments under Act 38 of that year.  Print Headline: Rouse to head up department

        A dive team on Monday recovered the body of a 35-year-old man who was reported missing in Beaver Lake in Northwest Arkansas over the weekend. A day earlier, authorities recovered the body of a 22-year-old man who drowned in the Mulberry River in west Arkansas. In the Beaver Lake accident, the Benton County sheriff's office received a call about 9 p.m. Saturday about a man who had fallen off a boat in the lake's Prairie Creek area, said Meyer Gilbert, chief deputy for the sheriff's office. The sheriff's office searched for the man Saturday night and for most of the day Sunday. The search resumed about 7 a.m. Monday, Gilbert said. About 1 p.m. Monday, they found the body of Edwin Jehovany Avila Garcia not far from the boat docks at Prairie Creek, about 100 to 150 yards from the no-wake zone, Gilbert said. "It was quite a bit away from the area of where the witnesses actually said they'd last seen him, so that's why it takes so long," he said. Gilbert said Garcia's death is being handled as a boating accident and the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission will handle the investigation. Garcia was one of seven people on the boat. The other people said Garcia had a medical emergency and fell off the boat, Gilbert said. Garcia's body will be taken to the Benton County coroner's office, Gilbert said. The incident occurred about one year after a similar one in the same area of the lake. A 27-year-old Fayetteville woman was reported as missing after falling out of a boat the evening of June 13, 2021, according to a sheriff's office spokesperson. Emergency responders, after an extensive search, recovered the woman's body two days later. In the Mulberry River accident, a man's body was recovered at 5 p.m. Sunday near the Silver Bridge, which crosses the Mulberry River and is on the line between Crawford and Franklin counties, according to Chief Deputy James Mirus of the Crawford County sheriff's office. In a Facebook post on Sunday evening, Mulberry Mayor Gary Baxter thanked those who assisted in the search and recovery effort at Silver Bridge, which he says began Friday and was led by Mirus. Mirus said Monday afternoon that teams initially responded in an attempt to rescue Edward Bennett, who went underwater. According to the chief deputy, witnesses said Bennett was swimming from side to side and was not a strong swimmer. The sheriff's office hadn't confirmed the identity of the body that was recovered Sunday, he said. The water was low, which Mirus said made it difficult to get resources like dive teams and sonar teams, along with equipment, in the river. "A citizen brought his airboat up because that was the only thing we could get in the water," Mirus said. Baxter also added that another drowning took place in the same location less than four weeks ago, on May 21. First responders transported the victim of that drowning, a man in his late 40s, to a local hospital where he later died. The chief deputy said that Silver Bridge is a popular swimming hole and has been for residents of Mulberry for generations. "In reality we have several drownings a year," Mirus said. "People are looking for free places to swim and cool off. That's the easiest thing to do, the first thing people do is go to the [river.]" Most people don't realize how strong the undercurrent is and get swept away, according to Mirus. He said that paying attention, staying with groups and using flotation devices can help improve safety when participating in water recreation.

         GARDINER, Mont. -- Most of Yellowstone National Park should reopen within the next two weeks -- much faster than originally expected after record floods pounded the region last week and knocked out major roads, federal officials said. Yellowstone Superintendent Cam Sholly said the park will be able to accommodate fewer visitors for the time being and it will take more time to restore road connections with some southern Montana communities. Park officials said Sunday they'll use $50 million in federal highway money to speed up road and bridge repairs. There's still no timetable for repairs to routes between the park and areas of Montana where the recovery is expected to stretch for months. Yellowstone will partially reopen at 8 a.m. Wednesday, more than a week after more than 10,000 visitors were forced out of the park when the Yellowstone and other rivers went over their banks after being swelled by melting snow and several inches of rainfall. Only portions of the park that can be accessed along its "southern loop" of roads will be opened initially, and access to the park's scenic backcountry will be for day hikers only.    Within two weeks officials plan to also open the northern loop, after previously declaring that it would likely stay closed through the summer season. The northern loop would give visitors access to popular attractions, including Tower Fall and Mammoth Hot Springs. They'd still be barred from the Lamar Valley, which is famous for its prolific wildlife, including bears, wolves and bison, that can often be seen from the roadside. "That would get 75 to 80% of the park back to working," National Park Service Director Charles "Chuck" Sams said Sunday during a visit to Yellowstone to gauge the flood's effects. It will take much longer -- possibly years -- to fully restore two badly damaged stretches of road that link the park with Gardiner to the north and Cooke City to the northeast. During a tour of damaged areas on Sunday, park officials showed reporters one of six sections of road near Gardiner where the raging floodwaters obliterated most of the roadway. Muddy water now courses through where the roadbed had been only a week ago. Trunks of huge trees litter the surrounding canyon. With no chances for an immediate fix, Sholly said 20,000 tons of material were being hauled in to construct a temporary, alternate route along an old road that runs above the canyon. That would let employees who work at the park headquarters in Mammoth get to their homes in Gardiner, Sholly said. The temporary route also could be used by commercial tour companies that have permits to lead guided visits. "We've gotten a lot more done than we thought we would a week ago," Sholly said. "It's going to be a summer of adjustments." The scope of the damage is still being tallied by Yellowstone officials, but based on other national park disasters, it could take years and carry a steep price tag to rebuild in an environmentally sensitive landscape -- with a huge underground plumbing system -- where construction season only runs from the spring thaw until the first snowfall. "They'll have to look at all the resources the park is designed to protect, and try to do this project as carefully as possible, but they're also going to try to go fairly quickly," said Brett Hartl, government affairs director at the Center for Biological Diversity. MONTANA TOLL Montana counties have also been surveying their damages. Some of those hardest hit in the disaster -- far from the park's limelight -- are leaning heavily on one another to pull their lives out of the mud. In and around the agricultural community of Fromberg, the Clarks Fork River flooded almost 100 homes and badly damaged a major irrigation ditch that serves many farms. The town's mayor says about a third of the flooded homes are too far gone to be repaired. In Red Lodge, nearly 150 homes were damaged or destroyed after Rock Creek escaped its banks last week. In Park County -- which includes Livingston, Gardiner and Cooke City -- a preliminary assessment of 437 structures found three residences were destroyed, 76 had moderate to major damage and another 126 had minor damage. Eight bridges and seven roads were destroyed, while 16 commercial buildings suffered moderate to major damage, officials said. Stillwater County officials were still tallying the damage there on Monday, following heavy rains on the weekend that caused the rivers to rise again, said Rich Cowger, the fire chief in Columbus. One house at the confluence of Rosebud Creek and the Stillwater River near Absarokee remained threatened on Monday, Cowger said. Elected officials who showed up to tour the damage in Red Lodge and Gardiner -- Montana tourist towns that serve as gateways to Yellowstone -- haven't made it to Fromberg to see its devastation. Matt Holmes combed through piles of muck and debris but could find little to save out of the trailer home that he shared with his wife and four children. Holmes had taken the day off, but said he needed to get back soon to his construction job so he could begin making money again. Whether he can bring in enough to rebuild is unclear. Holmes said he may move the family to Louisiana, where they have relatives. "I want to stay in Montana. I don't know if we can," he said.  Print Headline: Yellowstone set for fast reopening

        More than 18,000 Arkansans cast ballots in early voting for today's primary runoff in which there are contested runoffs for 10 legislative seats and various county offices in 30 of the state's 75 counties. Based on records released Monday by the secretary of state's office, the largest number of early votes had been cast in Baxter, Benton, Boone, Crawford and Greene counties. Voters who cast ballots in the May 24 primary must vote in the same party primary in the runoff, under state law. Voters who didn't vote in the May 24 primary may vote in either party primary in the runoff. There are Republican runoffs for three state Senate seats and seven House of Representatives seats to determine the party's nominees. [RESULTS: See the results of the 2022 primary runoff » arkansasonline.com/2022primaryrunoff/] The highest-profile state Senate runoff is a rematch between Sen. Bob Ballinger of Ozark and former Sen. Bryan King of Green Forest in Senate District 28. "I think we are in good shape, but we won't know until tomorrow," Ballinger, who ousted King in the Republican primary in 2018, said Monday. "If enough Republicans show up, we'll do good." King said that "it is just about turnout" in the runoff. "We'll see," he said. "Primaries are tough." Senate District 28 includes all of Carroll and Madison counties and parts of Boone, Franklin, Johnson and Newton counties. More than 1,000 early votes have been cast in the runoff election in Boone County, according to records released by the secretary of state's office on Monday afternoon. Beckie Benton, election coordinator in Boone County, said Monday the county judge runoff is primarily driving voter turnout, though the Senate District 28 runoff also is luring voters to the polls. Benton County election administrator Dana Caler said Monday afternoon that about 1,350 voters out of the 56,902 eligible runoff voters in Benton County had cast a vote in the runoff. [VOTER GUIDE: Get the details on which seats have contested runoffs + find your districts » arkansasonline.com/voter-guide/] "The runoff is usually lower as always," she said. "We are expecting about 10% total this year. The last primary runoff we had around 7%, but people are interested in the races that are going on right now." Caler said the Republican runoff in Senate District 35, between businessman Tyler Dees of Siloam Springs and state Rep. Gayla Hendren McKenzie of Gravette, and the Pea Ridge School Board elections are driving the interest right now. Washington County election coordinator Jennifer Price said that as of Monday afternoon 557 early votes had been cast during the runoff. "We do expect to see a pretty busy or steady Election Day turnout," she said. Price said she estimates 5% to 10% total turnout among eligible voters for the runoff. "We have a county judge race, a Senate race, a House district race and a constable race," she said, referring to the Senate District 35 runoff and the House District 23 runoff between Lincoln School Board member Kendra Moore and Washington County Quorum Court member Jim Wilson. McKenzie said Monday afternoon that "we are getting a good response. "We'll know more [today]," she said. Dees said he's thankful for the people who have gotten out to vote again in the runoff. "It's probably not wise to make a prediction before we get more info," he said. In the Senate District 22 runoff, state Rep. John Payton of Wilburn said he seems to have a lot of momentum in his bid to oust state Sen. James Sturch of Batesville, based on the feedback he has received on the streets, in restaurants and other places during the runoff. "I'm feeling good about the race," he said. Senate District 22 includes Independence and Sharp counties and parts of Cleburne, Fulton, Lawrence and Izard counties. But Sturch said Monday afternoon that 700 of the early votes in the runoff have been from voters in Independence County, and 270 of the early votes have been from voters in Cleburne County. "Giving it all we got!" he said in a text message. "Running [until] the end. Turnout is about 10% of what it was." In the House District 52 runoff in which he faces a challenge from farmer Mike Jones of Dardanelle, House Republican leader Marcus Richmond of Gravelly said he received an endorsement from Republican gubernatorial nominee Sarah Huckabee Sanders of Little Rock a few weeks ago. "We put it out there and kind of let other people make a big deal about it," he said. "I try not to overplay anything that we got going on. ... I really do appreciate her stepping up and doing that for me." House District 52 includes Scott County, two-thirds of Yell County and part of southern Sebastian County. But Jones said he doesn't think Sanders' endorsement of Richmond "has a whole lot of traction. "We haven't heard that that really hurt us," he said. More than 1,600 early votes have been cast in the runoff in Baxter County and more than 1,500 votes have been cast in the runoff in Crawford County, according to figures released by the secretary of state's office Monday afternoon. In Baxter County, "it's the county judge's race that's drawing in the people," said Canda Reese, county clerk and circuit clerk for Baxter County. In Crawford County, the runoffs for county judge, sheriff and clerk are helping drive voter turnout, said Ronda Robins, deputy county clerk. In Pulaski County, about 210, or less than 1% of eligible voters, had cast ballots in the runoff election, according to the Pulaski County Election Commission. Amanda Dickens, election coordinator for the Pulaski County Election Commission, said numbers are usually low during a runoff election. "One of the races is for constable, and that is not something voters are normally familiar with or what drives them out to the polls," she said. "The [justice of the peace] race has drawn out a little more people, but not much more. If it had been a higher-ranking office we would have gotten a lot more -- for example, if it was a state rep or something like that. But for that type of race it's probably typical." Dickens said she expects around 2% to 3% turnout total for the runoff election. According to the secretary of state's website, 457,856, or 26%, of the state's 1.76 million registered voters cast ballots in the May 24 primary. CORRECTION: Amanda Dickens is the election coordinator for the Pulaski County Election Commission. An earlier version of this article incorrectly identified her position.

        SPRINGDALE -- Improvements to existing streets could do as much or more to relieve traffic congestion as a new road, the Springdale City Council was told Monday. The council, meeting as a Committee of the Whole, agreed to recommend spending up to $359,850 for a transportation study by the Garver LLC engineering firm of Fayetteville to find options. Colby Fulfer, city chief of staff, told the council that right-hand turn lanes at the city's most congested intersections, for instance, could help traffic flow more than other options. The study would also identify exactly what projects should go first for design work to proceed, allowing the city to get right to work on those projects as soon as any money is available, Fulfer said. This is a major consideration at a time of rising costs, he said. "We estimate we could have saved 20% to 30% if the last round of projects had been shovel-ready," he said. The council recommended the study, which would have to be approved at a regular council meeting. The council will take up its own recommendation at its next regular meeting June 28. In other business, the council recommended acceptance of a settlement offer from First Presbyterian Church of Springdale in a property condemnation matter. The city wants to extend Har-Ber Avenue from 48th Street to Gutensohn Road, which would require taking some of the church's property. The city originally appraised the value of the property to be taken at $51,800. A private appraisal commissioned by the church valued the property at more than twice that. The church's offer of $91,800 splits the difference between the two appraisals, city staff told the council. Staff recommended the city take the offer since property prices are rising rapidly and the city's first appraisal is already out of date. Prices will keep rising as the matter awaits trial. Trial is set to begin in August, barring delays. Accepting the offer will also take formal action of the council at a regular council meeting. The committee recommended, without debate, accepting the state's offer of a one-time $5,000 stipend to law enforcement officers approved by the state Legislature. The council also explored the option of either reducing or capping the costs of city building permits on projects to repair or rebuild from damage done by the tornado that hit portions of the city on March 30. One city resident rebuilding his house had to spend $1,300 for the necessary permits, the council was told. The original proposal was to reduce permits issued on such projects by 25%, but the council decided any such measure would have to define precisely what would qualify for a cost reduction. City attorney Ernest Cate was assigned to research the matter and have a recommendation ready for the council at its next committee meeting in two weeks.

        Sandwiched between cases Friday in federal court in Little Rock, U.S. District Judge Lee Rudofsky presided over a different kind of hearing in which college students participating in a state government internship program watched a sentencing hearing and then questioned the judge on a variety of topics related to his job. After the sentencing hearing, Rudofsky spent about 40 minutes talking with participants in the state's MyARIntern program, describing the confirmation process that placed him on the federal bench and answering questions ranging from who his judicial heroes are to what his favorite part of his job is. The 47 students were on a field trip as part of a statewide public service intern program -- dubbed the MyARIntern Program -- which is a function the state's Department of Transformation and Shared Services "The intent of the program is to offer college students exposure to public service and government for encouragement toward that field," said Jana Hiland, the program director and human resources director with the department. Hiland said the ultimate goal of the program is to interest college students in public service by providing exposure to the inner workings of government through paid summer internships. On Friday, the students, who serve as interns in state government departments, such as the governor's office, Department of Human Services, and Department of Finance and Administration, visited the U.S. District Courthouse in Little Rock, as well as the state Supreme Court and other offices as part of the summer program's mission to educate its interns in the various functions of government and how different entities at different levels interact. In Rudofsky's courtroom, the interns sat in on a lengthy and detailed sentencing hearing in which a Lonoke County man was sentenced to more than 17 years in federal prison on a weapons charge as an armed career criminal. After giving the group an overview of his education, experience and the route he took that led to his nomination to the federal bench by former President Donald Trump in 2019, the New York native and Harvard-educated jurist took questions for nearly a half-hour, clearly enjoying the back-and-forth discussion. Rudofsky's judicial heroes, he said, are two U.S. Supreme Court justices who sit on opposite ends of the ideological spectrum: Justices Clarence Thomas and Elena Kagan. Of Thomas, a Supreme Court justice since 1991 following his nomination by former President George H.W. Bush, he said, "He is a very good and committed jurist ... committed to his way of judging regardless of the result in a particular case." Rudofsky said he took a class taught by Kagan at Harvard Law School and said since that time he had always had a "great relationship" with the justice, who served as dean of Harvard Law School from 2003 until 2009 when she was named U.S. solicitor general by former President Barack Obama, who nominated her for the high court the following year. "I think she kind of used me as kind of the token conservative in her class so we would often argue back and forth on issues of administrative law," he said. "She was a wonderful teacher, a wonderful dean but I think she used me in some sense to engage the class in a real discussion ... I also think she is very committed -- in a good way -- to her jurisprudential philosophy. She and I may disagree more than we don't but I think she does not care what the result is in a particular case. She does what she thinks the law requires and I admire that." Asked his favorite part of the job, Rudofsky paused for a moment to consider the question, then said collaborating with his law clerks on the drafting of rulings by hashing out the issues and researching legal precedents is the part he enjoys the most. "When we have meaty issues that are hard to figure out," he said, "I think it is kind of fun to go back and forth." Rudofsky said he employs an open-door policy and encourages vigorous debate among his clerks in attempting to find the best way forward. "I need to talk things out," he said. "I need to shoot ideas off of people, they come back and say this works or this doesn't work. When I was a practicing attorney that's always how it was and to me, that's always what our writing process tends to be like. ... I walk into their offices with issues I'm trying to figure out, they walk into my office with things I'm trying to figure out and to the extent there is fun in this job, the fun is really trying to figure out how to get to the right answer when there's a difficult problem." Rudofsky said although some cases are easy, three-quarters of the cases that come across his docket "present at least one hard, debatable issue" that he said once decided still leave room for some doubt and further examination. Then, going further, he addressed what he said is the hardest part of the job. "The hardest part of the job and the only part of the job that I lose sleep over is what you just saw," Rudofsky said, referring the sentencing hearing that preceded the question and answer session. "That is incredibly difficult, incredibly emotionally draining, you literally have someone's life in your hands." He said such decisions not only place the life of the defendant under the will of the judge, but also the lives of others including family members, past victims and their families, and potential future victims should a guilty defendant go on to commit more crimes. The intricacies in crafting a sentence that is -- to follow the legal sentencing framework that it be "sufficient but no more than necessary," to address the criminal behavior that brings defendant and judge together, to promote respect for the law and to provide deterrence to the defendant and to others -- is daunting, he said. "You don't want to take away their freedom for a day more than you have to, right?" Rudofsky said. "That's a terrible, terrible thing, but you also don't want to have a situation where someone gets out earlier than they should, they haven't been rehabilitated and, God forbid, they kill someone or hurt someone or they hurt society. That's an incredibly tough thing to figure out and the truth is, there's no right answer." Arkansas' Department of Transformation and Shared Services bills the MyARIntern Program as a tool to provide college students, recent college graduates and veterans with real-world experience in state government through paid internships in a variety of state government career fields. Hiland said those selected for the program, now in its second year, receive $12 an hour in compensation for working inside the state departments they are assigned to.

         100 years ago June 21, 1922 FAYETTEVILLE -- Courses in practical wireless will be emphasised at the University of Arkansas summer school this year. At least three courses dealing directly with radio will be offered, and a considerable amount of interest is expected in the subject outside the classroom. Prof. Giles E. Ripley, head of the University Department of Physics, will offer a regular course in practical and theoretical wireless, using all the University radio apparatus in connection with the course, and considering such matters as the overcoming of static, securing the best results from various types of receiving and sending sets, proper erection of aerials, and similar subjects. 50 years ago June 21, 1972 The state Education Department has announced that Arkansas is one of five states to receive planning grants for expansion of an education program for low-income children. The $50,000 Arkansas grant was made for the Education Department to develop a plan that could be used by other states in the Follow Through program, designed to help low-income children in the first three grades. After the planning period, Arkansas will be eligible to receive $1 million for Follow Through programs in eight to 10 new school districts. The plan will determine how the committees will be selected and the money spent. 25 years ago June 21, 1997 PINE BLUFF -- Sparks from a cutting torch caused a fire that destroyed the Townsend Park Elementary School Wednesday afternoon, Fire Marshal David Parsley said Thursday. A worker using a torch to remove windows on the east wing of the school at 2601 Fluker St. ignited some wooden casings that surrounded windows. The flames quickly spread to the attic and soon swallowed the building, Parsley said. No charges will be brought against the worker. "It was just an accidental fire," Parsley said. The loss of the U-shaped complex was valued at $1.5 million. 10 years ago June 21, 2012 This October, almost 180 World War II veterans from Arkansas will board two US Airways Airbus planes bound for Washington, D.C., from Little Rock. Doctors, nurses and chaperones, called "guardians," will accompany the men and women to the National World War II Memorial, which was dedicated to their service in 2004. "They don't evidently trust us 91-year-old guys to be alone," former Air Force pilot Donald Anderson, of Horseshoe Bend, joked. He turns 91 on Oct. 6. It's an "honor flight," a free visit to the nation's capital provided by the Electrical Cooperatives of Arkansas, Wal-Mart Foundation and Tyson Foods. Since October 2009, five honor flights from the Northwest Arkansas Regional Airport have granted 432 Arkansas veterans the chance to visit the monument some of their comrades never lived to see.

         Little Rock police on Monday morning said investigators were still working to identify the victim of a weekend shooting. Officers responded to a ShotSpotter alert shortly after 2:40 a.m. Sunday in the area of 1321 S. Jefferson St., according to a police report. Officers searched the area and found the victim, a male who had an apparent gunshot wound. He was later pronounced dead, the report stated. A preliminary investigation did not turn up the victim's identity, and the body was transported by the Pulaski County coroner's office to the Arkansas State Crime Laboratory for an autopsy and testing for positive identification, according to the department. Detectives determined the shooting was "isolated" and that no threat is present for the area, authorities said. They asked anyone with information related to the homicide to contact detectives at (501) 371-4660. Tips can be submitted anonymously by calling (501) 371-4636 or through the "YourLRPD" smartphone app.  Print Headline: LR police: Shot man dies from injuries

        EL DORADO -- The jury trial for an El Dorado man charged with first-degree murder is set to begin Monday at the Union County Courthouse. Ronald Pierce, 51, was arrested Sept. 5, 2020, and charged in the killing of Willie Candley. The trial is scheduled to last two days, according to a trial docket sheet issued for Judge Hamilton Singleton's 13th Judicial District, Division 1 courtroom. A trial date in late April was delayed because Pierce's attorney, Jimmy Morris, had another trial scheduled on the same day elsewhere in the state. According to court records, El Dorado police responded to a call Sept. 5, 2020, on Marsh Avenue and upon arrival officers observed a suspect and a knife with blood on the picnic table in the front yard. Officers also noted a victim lying in the yard and bleeding. Police later identified Pierce as a suspect and Willie Candley as the victim. Pierce was arrested and Candley was transported to the Medical Center of South Arkansas, where he died of his injuries. A witness told investigators that Pierce asked them for a gun "prior to stabbing Candley," documents state. Pierce "subsequently confessed" when investigators interviewed him, according to court documents, saying he had been involved in a "physical altercation" with Candley and asked the witness for a gun but was denied. Pierce also told police he "stabbed Candley in the torso," according to documents.

        FAYETTEVILLE -- Those interested have until the end of the month to take part in a community needs survey that will help shape a new strategic plan for the library. An online survey is posted to the library's website, faylib.org. It will stay open until June 30. The library has contracted with consultant Ivy Group in Charlottesville, Va., on a community assessment effort. The group so far has led six community focus groups, two community needs forums and three staff visioning sessions to evaluate needs and library support, according to information presented to the library's board on Monday. The library also has taken part in a benchmark study to see where it stacks up to other libraries across the country, receiving high marks across several categories, Executive Director David Johnson told the board. Feedback from community leaders also will be integrated into the assessment, he said. The online survey has netted about 650 responses, Johnson said. An internal library staff survey also will remain open until the end of the month, he said. The goal is have the assessment completed by late July, Johnson said. The library will then be able to come up with an updated strategic plan, he said. "It's going to help us get a road map for the future," Johnson said. The most recent strategic plan was the library's master plan released in 2012. The plan said the library needed to double its size and would need millage increase to do it. City voters approved a property tax increase in 2016 to build an expanded library, which opened in January 2021. "We're starting the work now to say what are we going to need to do, where do we need to be, as the community grows," Johnson said. In other business, Johnson told board members the city is interested in doing more sidewalk and street work south of the library. The city's contractor associated with construction of the cultural arts corridor downtown, Nabholz, has been using the open acre south of the library to stage their work. The original plan for the Fay Jones woods portion of the arts corridor was to have street and sidewalk work done on West Avenue extending to South Street. On Friday, city officials contacted library administration, saying the work could extend farther south to Prairie Street. In addition, improvements could be made on South School Avenue to Archibald Yell Boulevard and portions of South Street, Johnson said. The city asked the library for more time to use the open acre for staging construction work, saying it could take until November, Johnson said. Johnson told board members he wanted to revisit the agreement with the city to potentially have some improvements made to the library property in exchange for its extended use, such as plumbing for sprinklers or electrical work.

        HOT SPRINGS -- A Little Rock man on parole who fled from a traffic stop in March, prompting a high-speed pursuit that ended when spike strips were deployed, was sentenced to five years in prison Monday after pleading guilty in Garland County Circuit Court. Zachary Remington Dixon, 25, who has remained in custody since his arrest March 10, pleaded guilty to felony fleeing, punishable by up to 10 years in prison, and was sentenced to five years. An additional felony charge of first-degree criminal mischief was withdrawn in district court along with numerous misdemeanor charges and traffic violations. According to court records, Dixon was convicted Nov. 7, 2017, in Garland County of possession of a firearm by certain persons and sentenced to six years in prison, but later paroled. He was previously convicted in 2016 in Garland County of possession of drug paraphernalia and sentenced to five years in prison. According to the probable cause affidavit, around 9:45 a.m. March 10, Arkansas State Police Trooper 1st Class Dylan Robbins was patrolling in the area of Central Avenue near Amity Road when he saw a white Ford sport utility vehicle with expired tags. He got behind the SUV as it turned onto Amity and then pulled into a parking spot at Harps Food Store, 5536 Central Ave., and activated his lights to make a traffic stop, according to the court records. A white female passenger got out and walked toward Robbins while the driver, later identified as Dixon, opened his door and looked at the trooper while saying "something about a job interview." Dixon then shut the door and sped off, heading west on Amity with Robbins in pursuit. He noted that Dixon "demonstrated complete disregard for the safety and welfare of motorists by traveling at a high rate of speed and passing in no-passing zones, passing in blind curves and passing over blind hilltops." Robbins said Dixon forced numerous motorists to "run off the roadway" by getting in their lane. During the pursuit, they passed a Garland County sheriff's deputy who began to follow and alerted other deputies including one ahead of them who said he would put out a spike strip. The SUV continued passing other vehicles at a high rate of speed, Robbins said, noting that when he would get closer to attempt a PIT maneuver, the driver would "brake check" him. A PIT, or "precision immobilization technique," maneuver is a method used by some law enforcement agencies to stop fleeing vehicles by temporarily disabling them. As they passed South Moore Road, Robbins was advised the spike strip had been deployed "just ahead of us" so he backed off as the SUV hit the strip. The SUV continued about half a mile before the driver lost control, left the roadway, struck a wooden sign and stopped in a ditch. Dixon attempted to drive out of the ditch, so Robbins put the front of his unit against the driver's side door to keep him from getting back on Amity. Robbins got out and began giving orders to Dixon, but he reportedly refused to roll his window down so Robbins broke the window to get to him. Robbins and Trooper Justin Parker finally pulled Dixon out and took him to the ground. When asked, Dixon reportedly said he was not injured and declined to be checked out by LifeNet personnel. A computer check showed that Dixon had warrants for parole violations and from other agencies. He was set for an arraignment Monday, but opted to plead guilty instead at the hearing.

        A Shannon Hills police officer resigned Monday after being charged Saturday night with felony theft of a motor vehicle, assault in the first degree, driving while intoxicated and refusal to submit to chemical testing. Jose Padilla, 30, of Alexander, remained in the Pulaski County jail Monday with no bond set. Shannon Hills Police Chief Allen Spears confirmed Padilla resigned Monday. An off-duty Little Rock officer was working at Trinity night club at about 4:55 a.m. when he noticed a commotion nearby on 1021 Jessie Road, according to a police report. A group of men told the officer Padilla had stolen a vehicle, the report stated. The officer noted he saw Padilla nearly hit multiple pedestrians while attempting to flee from the location. The Little Rock officer tried to pull Padilla from the vehicle, the report stated. It stated that another witness punched Padilla in the side of the head at the same time. Padilla was detained and the Little Rock officer contacted the owner of the vehicle. The vehicle's owner told police he was helping an intoxicated family member when Padilla entered the vehicle and began to drive away. Padilla had slurred speech, appeared to be drowsy and smelled of alcohol, according to the report. His eyes were also bloodshot and watery and he had trouble standing, according to authorities. An ambulance transported Padilla to the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences in Little Rock, where he became combative with medical staff, the report stated. He was admitted into the intensive care unit at the hospital and later transported to the Pulaski County jail.  Print Headline: Jailed Shannon Hills officer resigns

        A man was fatally shot on Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard in Texarkana about noon on Monday, police said. The man, whose identity was withheld, died at a hospital, said Cpl. Kelly Pilgreen of the Texarkana Police Department. Officers were dispatched to a shooting in the 300 block of Martin Luther King Boulevard and the 700 block of Laurel Street in Texarkana. When they arrived in the 300 block of Martin Luther King Boulevard, officers found a dark-colored sedan had crashed into a residence, Pilgreen said. The driver appeared to have a gunshot wound. A female passenger was possibly injured from the crash, Pilgreen said. The driver and passenger were transported to a local hospital. The man's identity has been held until the next of kin can be notified. The female's identity is also being withheld because she is a victim in the case, police said. A warrant has been issued for Trenkale Martinez Brunson, 29, of Texarkana, who is wanted for murder in the first degree, possession of a firearm by certain persons and unlawful discharge of a firearm from a vehicle, Pilgreen said. The investigation is ongoing, the department said.  Print Headline: 1 killed, 1 hurt in Texarkana shooting
