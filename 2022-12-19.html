        Freezing weather is forecasted statewide Thursday through Christmas Day, with some parts of Arkansas having a high chance of seeing snow, according to the National Weather Service. “If you are a cold-weather person and you love Christmas to be cold and stuff, youre in luck this year,” Justin Condry, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in North Little Rock, said. According to the meteorologist, showers will start early Thursday morning, then an Arctic front will pass through the state during the afternoon and evening hours, will last until Sunday. Lows are predicted to be in the single digits and teens on Thursday, with central Arkansas forecast to dip to eight degrees. Condry said there isnt a set amount snow accumulation across the state, but amounts are not expected to be significant.  According to the weather service, light snow is predicted from northern into central Arkansas. The highest amounts of snow will likely be over northern parts of the state, with a possible one to two inches. “Right now most places are going to start with rain, and then theyll most likely transition into a wintry mix like rain and snow, or they may transition over to snow completely,” Condry said. “A lot of it depends on how quick that temperature can flip over to that 32-degree mark or lower.” Low temperatures will be in the single digits and teens Friday morning. The weather service said below-zero readings are expected in the Ozark Mountains. Breezy, northwest winds will create below-zero wind chills statewide. Condry said the wind chill will make the already sub-freezing conditions feel colder. “A negative 12-degree wind chill is possible here in Little Rock, they have negative 26 degrees right now for wind chill value in Fayetteville,” he said.  Wind gusts as high as 35 miles per hour are expected Thursday and Friday.  Saturday will bring highs in the 30s and lows in the single digits and teens as well, statewide. The weather service said this will be some of the coldest air the state has seen in “quite a long time.” “Its not uncommon for us to necessarily get this cold, a lot of times well see this stuff in January or February – not prolonged, its usually like a quick cold snap, and then were back to normal,” he said. The meteorologist said cold fronts like this do happen, just not as frequently.  While highs reached the mid-to-upper 70s on Christmas Day last year, Arkansans can expect cold air this year. Highs are expected to be in the low-to-mid 30s and some parts of the state will finally climb above freezing on Sunday. Condry encouraged those that have pets to bring them inside and to keep faucets dripping at night to avoid busted pipes. He also advised people to bundle up and limit time outside because of the dangerous, cold air and winds. The Little Rock Compassion Center, located at 3618 W. Roosevelt Road, is opening its warming center this weekend for those who are less fortunate. Pastor William Holloway, founder and chief executive of the Compassion Center, said the warming center and other areas will be open until temperatures become increase. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner will be served throughout the weekend and turkey will be served on Christmas Day, according to Holloway.

        Three people were killed in a crash Sunday in Cross County, according to a preliminary report from Arkansas State Police. State police said Helen Collins, 78, of Wynne, was driving northbound in a 1996 Chevrolet on Arkansas 1 near the Barry Street East intersection. Kameisha Smith, 23, of Wynne was traveling in a 2007 Pontiac south on the highway. Collins was in the center lane, and turned west towards Barry Street East in front of Smiths vehicle. According to the report, Smith's vehicle collided with Collins vehicle in the inside southbound lane, killing both women and an unnamed minor in Smiths vehicle just before 6 p.m. Two other minors were injured in the Pontiac and were taken to an area hospital for their injuries. Police reported the weather was clear and the road was dry at the time of the crash.

        Last month, the Arkansas Department of Transportation began an operation aimed at clearing homeless people and panhandlers from numerous Little Rock-area intersections as part of general upkeep. The Arkansas branch of the American Civil Liberties Union believes it could be violating those people's Eighth Amendment rights. The operation began Nov. 21 when the Department of Transportation notified homeless people located at North Rodney Parham Road and Interstate 430 that they had seven days to collect their belongings and leave the area, so crews could clean up trash and mow the area. Similar operations were expected to take place in the following weeks at the intersection of University Avenue and Interstate 630, and at the intersection by McCain Mall near U.S. 67/167 in North Little Rock. One notification operation had been scheduled for Dec. 6 at the Springer Boulevard/Arkansas 365 overpass, but was cancelled that morning. It hadn't been rescheduled as of Thursday. According to department spokesperson Dave Parker, none of the affected people are being moved out of the city or to any other location, and no large encampments are being targeted. But two years ago, a federal judge in Arkansas ruled that panhandlers could not be arrested for asking for assistance. A similar issue is playing out in Dallas, where last week the city was sued for a law that subjects people to fines of up to $500 for standing on road medians. The Arkansas ACLU had been involved in the Arkansas case. On Thursday, the ACLU provided a photo taken by a staff member in the vicinity of the Rodney Parham and I-430 intersection on Dec. 7. The photo shows a "No Trespassing" sign, which cites state statute 5-39-203 for criminal trespass, which has varying levels of offense. "The DOT put up no trespassing signs despite the fact that this is public property," said Holly Dickson, executive director of the Arkansas ACLU, in a statement. "Federal courts of appeals in this country have already found that it is cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment to prohibit unhoused people from staying in public spaces. We, as a state, need to stop trying to criminalize people out of poverty and instead do more to ensure that all Arkansans have safe and affordable housing, access to mental and physical healthcare, education, meals, and other necessaries." The Eighth Amendment states that "excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted." "I'm not gonna get into a back and forth with the ACLU," Parker said Thursday in response to the ACLU statement. "I'll be honest, that's the first that I'd seen that we'd put up any no trespassing signs," he followed up. After checking with department engineers, Parker confirmed that similar signs had been put up by the Department of Transportation in similar areas. "I can't say we put up that sign, but we have put them up," Parker said. "Our intent is not to get anyone arrested. "I can tell you that the reason we put those signs up are in areas of right of way, which we have to maintain," Parker said. "So they're saying we put them in public spaces, I'm saying we put them in areas that we are obligated to maintain. And in order to maintain them safely and properly, we have to give people notice. The last thing we want to do, and anyone wants, us, ACLU or you, is for us to go in and start mowing an area without notice and guess what? Someone's there, and then there's an accident, and that's not going to be good. So yes, we have put up those signs in areas that we are obligated to maintain in order to give proper notice." In an interview on Nov. 30, Parker said the Department of Transportation consulted with Little Rock, North Little Rock, police departments and other agencies about the intersection effort. "This is not our DOT [unilaterally] deciding on November 21, we need to do something about it," Parker said. "It's a joint effort, a joint discussion that goes on pretty much year round about what's the best way to handle this and the reason we have to go in and do it, no one likes to be in that position to say 'hey, you got to move.' We understand the predicament everyone's in and certainly sympathetic toward that." Also part of the operation is Little Rock's homeless service advocate, Chris Porter. Porter goes out with the department's crews when the notifications occur. He provides information to the people being displaced from intersections about where they could potentially go for help. "I've been talking with people in those right of ways for years without the coordination with the Department of Transportation, because they're in the city, and because they're in right of ways of the city, not because they're on state property," Porter said. "My main objective is to connect them to services, some wraparound services to help them to get back on their feet or at least get in a better position than they're in," Porter said. "So I came in contact with the Arkansas Department of Transportation because there was a lot of issues with homeless camps, littering, different parts of the street and those areas of course owned by the department transportation. I included myself in a meeting with them and ... the objective was they needed to make sure that their people were safe and the people were safe on the property." Porter defined wraparound services as helping with mental health issues, substance abuse issues, finding alternative shelters and assisting with bus passes. Alternative shelters include the Compassion Center, which has a 200-bed facility for overnight care that services men. It also runs "Awaken," a 75-bed facility for women and children that is application based. At the time of the interview on Dec. 1, Porter had spoken with 20 to 25 people as part of the Department of Transportation's operation. While the Department of Transportation isn't moving people itself, one local homeless activist would like to see a version of it. "I don't know what that looks like or what that could be, what the alternative could be," said Aaron Reddin, founder and executive director of The Van. "Maybe help them move to the next stop they gotta go to." Reddin then cited a project called the Colorado Village Collaborative. According to the program's website, it's a tiny home community project that began in December 2020 in partnership with the city and county of Denver to respond to the covid-19 pandemic. The Colorado Village Collaborative now operates three Safe Outdoor Spaces in the Denver metro area. "They've had good success with that being able to provide some kind of alternative option," Reddin said. "We've gotta come up with something. We got to do something other than 'move, move, move, move.'"  Print Headline: ACLU blasts anti-trespass corner signs

         'Tis the season for Christmas giving. 'Tis also the season for scammers scheming. With the holidays in full swing, the Federal Bureau of Investigation is cautioning Americans and Arkansans to proceed with caution when it comes to whom and what they choose to give their money to in the name of holiday cheer. According to the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), Americans lost over $6.9 billion to fraudsters just in 2021. During this time of year, the FBI cautions specifically against online shopping scams, fraudulent social media posts and charity scams. In 2021, more than $335 million was lost by Americans in online shopping and non-delivery scams. Arkansans aren't immune. According to reports filed with the IC3, which an FBI spokesperson called just the "tip of the iceberg," Arkansans reported 2,348 cases of fraud totaling more than $10 million in 2021: $222,235 was reportedly lost to credit card fraud. $135,314 was lost to personal data breaches. $1,347,756 was taken in confidence/romance schemes. "Arkansas citizens, by and large, are a generous people, they give with everything they have, whether it's time or money, and scammers know that and they want to capitalize on it," said FBI spokesperson Connor Hagan. During this time of year, the FBI tends to see even more scams of the fake charity variety, as scammers prey on people's emotions. Hagan cited "absolutely fake" GoFundMe campaigns that are shared on social media by people who are in no way "malicious," but "falling into the emotion of, 'I want to help.' ... It needs to be tempered with, 'I want to help, but I want to make sure that this is going to the people that it needs to help.'" Another FBI spokesperson, Jessica Franklin, said "during this time of the year ... there's like a sense of urgency online. 'Oh, I need to click on a link right now, I need to purchase this right now, I need to answer these questions right now, before this deal goes away." Hagan added that scammers "are not dumb, they have to be smart. They have to know how to input that sense of urgency, they have to know how to tug at your heartstrings and play on those emotions. And they have to know where their victims or potential victims are looking at, what they're looking for. And they're very good. They've gotten very good at that." Put simply, Hagan said, "think before you link." When it comes to potential charity scams, Franklin cautioned people to make sure the organization has a legitimate Taxpayer Identification Number. A Taxpayer Identification Number is an identification number used by the Internal Revenue Service in the administration of tax laws. It is issued either by the Social Security Administration or by the IRS. "Any legitimate nonprofit organization should be able to provide you that number," Franklin said. "You can get that through visiting their website or calling the organization directly. And personally, I would not donate to a charitable organization if they could not provide me with that number."

        Minister John Miles of the Jonesboro First United Methodist Church preached Sunday, as promised, despite his suspension. Miles and Bill Bristow, an attorney and member of Stay UMC Jonesboro, declined to comment Sunday because of possible legal action. Miles was suspended Friday, one day after overseeing a meeting to adopt new bylaws and new lay leadership for Jonesboro First United Methodist Church. Northeast District Superintendent John Fleming previously urged Miles not to hold the meeting, warning that the proposed action items were "clearly contrary to the Constitution of the United Methodist Church" and would not be "recognized by the State of Arkansas or the Arkansas Conference of the United Methodist Church." But the meeting, organized by church members wishing to break away from the denomination, went forward as planned, with those present voting 629 to 9 against remaining with the United Methodist Church. The bylaws and leaders provisions passed by similarly lopsided margins. In a letter to the Arkansas Annual Conference late Friday afternoon, Bishop Gary Mueller said he had suspended Miles "from all pastoral duties effective immediately." In a video posted on the congregation's Facebook page, Miles acknowledged his suspension from ministry but indicated he won't be going anywhere. "This is all part of a legal process and I just want you to know I'll be here Sunday. I plan to be here for the following Sundays," he said. Information for this article was contributed by Frank E. Lockwood of the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette.  Print Headline: Methodist minister continues to preach despite suspension

         FAYETTEVILLE -- Center for Public Health and Technology researchers will dive deeper into a trifecta of addiction issues in order to help people, courtesy of nearly $2 million in grants from the National Institutes of Health. Page Dobbs, interim director of the Center, "received an $800,126 Tobacco Regulatory Science K01 award from the National Cancer Institute to explore social media discussions about policy loopholes, enforcement challenges, and industry interferences with tobacco control policies." Alex Russell, associate director of technology for the Center, "received a $735,000 grant to conduct a study that seeks to characterize alcohol use disorder and recovery-related exposures on Twitter to define prominent barriers to -- and facilitators of -- recovery, as well to identify targets for later intervention." And Mance Buttram, associate director of research for the Center, "received a $436,653 R21 award from the National Institute on Drug Abuse to be the first to examine how Gabapentin, an anti-convulsant medication, can be non-medically used in combination with prescription and illicit opioids," according to the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville. The Center, part of the university's College of Education and Health Professions, is a "new hub for interdisciplinary research focusing on public health, communication, health literacy, and emerging media and digital technologies." Because the Center for Public Health and Technology is so new -- only really launching within the past year -- getting "these three grants will be really transformative for the Center, and we're very excited about them," Buttram said. All three joined the Center within the past couple of years. "We want to reach out and engage with the community even more," Buttram said, adding that the Center illustrates "the university's focus on high-level research and researchers." UA-Fayetteville has received the highest classification of research activity from the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, earning the designation of "Research 1 -- Doctoral University: Very High Research Activity." TOBACCO USE Dobbs will explore social media discussions about tobacco control policies to understand how people avoid enforcement through policy loopholes, the challenges people experience when attempting to enforce these laws, and how tobacco industries are trying to interfere with the enactment and enforcement of emerging tobacco laws, according to the university. Though smoking rates have declined over the past half-century, the tobacco industry has shifted to promoting novel tobacco products -- like electronic cigarettes -- to youth and young adults, and use of e-cigarettes among that demographic has increased over the past decade. Dobbs is "an expert who has done a lot of work in the field, and [research produced by] this grant will be really informative," Buttram said. The data will help inform recommendations to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration regarding tobacco policies. Examining social media platforms for this research is "really innovative," Buttram said. Dobbs will "be able to understand in real time how the general population is discussing on these platforms and how they're playing out in the real world." ALCOHOL USE Russell's funding is courtesy of K01, an esteemed research career development award funded by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, part of the National Institutes of Health. His study, "Characterizing alcohol use disorder recovery-related exposures on social media: Content, cluster, and network analysis," will continue until 2027. More than 3 million Americans ages 18-25 met the diagnostic criteria for an alcohol use disorder last year, and prior research has established that social media use and engagement influence health behaviors, including alcohol use, according to the university. However, social media platforms can also encourage healthy behaviors, such as abstinence from -- or reductions in -- drinking. As is the case with Dobbs' grant, Russell's will provide "real-time data [from] social media and on its impact," Buttram said. "This is fascinating and important work." Technology is a key part of the Center, as is a focus on substance-abuse issues, he added. "We want to do research that is collaborative and meaningful." OPIOID USE Findings from Buttram's study, "An Examination of Concomitant Non-Medical Use of Gabapentin and Opioids," will help prescribers and substance use disorder treatment providers understand how gabapentin is used in "real-world" environments, then develop screening tests accordingly, he said. "Limited data show that Gabapentin is used by individuals with opioid use disorder to potentiate the euphoric effects of opioids, but at the same time, data also show that Gabapentin is used to self-treat symptoms of opioid use disorder and physical pain experienced by people who use drugs," he said. Buttram, currently a principal investigator for a national surveillance study of prescription drug diversion -- the illegal distribution or abuse of prescription drugs or their use for purposes not intended by the prescriber -- has been focused on gabapentin for several years, since learning from law enforcement that they had seen increased reports of diversion of gabapentin, he said. While it can treat conditions like epilepsy, some use it to potentiate the euphoric effects of opioids, to self-treat pain or to aid in withdrawal symptoms from opioid use. "We're interested in the combination use of Gabapentin," he said, adding that data from those surveyed ought to be reliable, because the information will be gleaned from individuals in treatment for substance-use disorders. Those "people are very open and honest, they're used to providing information, and many want to help move science forward and [assist] others" by sharing their experiences.

         The Madison County Quorum Court has passed a resolution to issue bonds and collect a sales tax for construction of a new jail. Voters on Nov. 8 approved a 0.5% sales tax for a maximum $16.9 million bond issue to finance construction of a new jail and sheriff's office. But voters rejected a 1.25% sales tax to pay for maintenance and operation of the facility. County Judge Frank Weaver said the county will begin collecting the sales tax on April 1. Weaver said there will be more discussion before final decisions are made regarding the jail. He said a site has yet to be selected, and another sales tax could go before the public to pay for maintenance and operation of the facility. Weaver said it would cost about $16 million to build a 148-bed jail. He said a 0.5% sales tax would bring in about $1.1 million per year based on current collection rates. Weaver said the 0.5% tax would sunset when the bonds are paid off. The 1.25% tax would have been perpetual. According to the resolution, county officials are authorized to work with Friday, Eldredge & Clark LLP as bond counsel and Stephens Inc. as underwriter to prepared documents for the bond issue. If construction could start in 2024, Weaver said, the building could be in use by mid-2025. On three previous occasions, Madison County asked voters to approve a sales tax to help fund construction of a new jail or at least an addition to the existing jail. The tax proposals were rejected all three times. Luke Dotson, a member of the Quorum Court, said he thinks the county should scale back the proposal to a 75-bed jail. "The jail doesn't necessarily have to be as big as we first thought," he said. The county could then ask voters to approve a smaller tax for maintenance and operation, said Dotson. "A smaller jail just cuts the whole operations bill in half," he said. The 0.5% tax passed by voters on Nov. 8 didn't specify the size of the jail or number of beds. Dotson said Madison County has fewer than 17,000 residents, but it's considering a jail the size of counties' with twice the population. He said the county could build a smaller jail now, then go back to the voters later if more money is needed to expand the facility. Weaver said Madison County has between 40 and 60 inmates housed in other jails at any given time, and "we're releasing that many more who need to be in jail." "Why would you build a jail that doesn't even meet your needs now?" he said. "If you're going to build a facility, build it for 20 or 30 years down the road. Building costs are only going to increase as time goes on." Weaver said it would be difficult to get voters to approve another jail construction tax while they're paying the 0.5% approved by voters last month. In 2014, the state's 4th District Criminal Detention Facilities Review Committee found that the Madison County jail -- which was built in the early 1980s to accommodate eight beds -- didn't comply with state standards, so it was converted to a 24-hour holding facility. From 2015 until the end of 2021, Madison County's longer-term detainees were held in the Washington County jail -- 30 miles to the west in Fayetteville. But with that jail overcrowded, Washington County Sheriff Tim Helder ended the agreement. Since then, Madison County Sheriff Rick Evans has been housing his detainees at various jails around the state that have room. Besides the cost of paying other counties to house detainees, transportation has been a factor since some of the Madison County detainees are housed as far away as the Lafayette County jail in Lewisville, about 300 miles to the south. SouthBuild Team of Collierville, Tenn., has been consulting with Madison County on the proposed jail project. There will be some changes next month. Weaver is retiring after 12 years as county judge. Seven of the nine members of the Quorum Court will be new (Dotson lost his race for reelection). Weaver said the county will also have a new sheriff, county clerk, circuit clerk, treasurer, assessor and collector.  Print Headline: JPs to collect sales tax for new jail

         The Pulaski County Special School District is taking 20 of its older diesel-fuel burning school buses off the road, destroying them and replacing them with almost $2 million in school buses fueled by propane. The acquisition of the propane buses is the result of: A memorandum of understanding between the 12,000-student school system and the Arkansas Department of Energy and Environment's Division of Environmental Quality. Beneficiary disbursements from the Volkswagen Settlement Environmental Mitigation Trust. The district's School Board approved an agreement on the bus deal with the state last week. The state Division of Environmental Quality will reimburse the school district up to $1,960,000, or $98,000 per bus, to purchase up to 20 propane buses and scrap 20 diesel buses. Eligible expenses include the purchase price of the new buses, delivery costs of the new buses, the cost to scrap and dispose of the buses being replaced and taxes, if applicable. Once the district has the propane school buses, it will have no more than 30 days to scrap the diesel buses. That is to be done by cutting a 3-inch hole or larger in the engine block of each engine and cutting the frame rails of each vehicle completely in half. Before-and-after photographs of the decommissioned buses will be required as part of the agreement. Charles Blake, the Pulaski County Special district's director of transportation, was delighted last week with the news that the district had been selected for the $2 million bus plan, saying the grant will provide the district with 20 new buses that it would otherwise have to purchase with district funds. Each of the buses to be destroyed is 14 years old or older and has exceeded its life expectancy, he said. "This is a dream we have been working for the past four years," Blake told the district's School Board last week. The district already has some experience with the propane buses and supporting equipment because it had received similar but smaller grants in 2019 and 2021. Each of those grants enabled the district to purchase two propane-fueled buses for a total of four, starting the district's clean-air program, Blake said. Blake said the district has the fueling infrastructure it needs for the propane buses in the south part of the district, but 10 of the new buses will go to the northwest section of the district, five more will go to the Maumelle area and five to the Sherwood area. "We're going to put in infrastructure, but it isn't costly," Blake said. The district will have the old buses scrapped and receive about $1,500 for each, which will be available for district use. School Board member Eli Keller praised Blake and the district's transportation department. He called the new bus plan "an incredible feat because you stretch these buses to their limits and then you stretch them past that, and you do so with never a gripe that gets back to me. "Thank you from the bottom of my heart. I am extremely impressed," Keller said. Stephen Delaney, the board's president, said he didn't believe Blake when he first said the district might be able to acquire the large number of new buses. "I was wrong," Delaney said to laughter. "It's awesome," he said about the grant. The money for the grants comes from a settlement of charges that the producers of the Volkswagen family of cars violated the federal Clean Air Act by selling approximately 590,000 model year 2009 to 2016 diesel motor vehicles that were equipped with "defeat devices." Those devices were in the form of computer software designed to cheat on federal emissions tests. The major excess pollutant at issue was oxide of nitrogen, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.  Print Headline: Pulaski County schools set for switch to propane buses

         COLCORD, Okla. -- Brad Hickman has been working to make lemons into lemonade by turning a hobby into a prospective business. Hickman has had noncancerous tumors in his brain since 2002 and has been unable to work because of his condition since 2016, he said. Hickman found his passion in creating art by burning images into pieces of wood and is now working to turn this into a potential business. The tumors eventually forced Hickman to give up his career as a physical education teacher in Colcord, Okla., he said. Now Hickman lives with his family outside of Colcord and routinely takes trips to Little Rock for medical treatment for his tumors. "I started Artistry Creations to have something to do," Hickman said. Hickman usually burns stuff at random, usually just whatever strikes his fancy, he said. However, Hickman said he has also started doing custom orders. Over the two years he has been burning wood, Hickman has learned that some woods are easier to burn than others. Soft woods burn easily. The toughest thing Hickman had ever burned on was Gourd, he said. Hickman said a friend brought a wood burning kit over one day and played around with it. This inspired Hickman to get his own kit, he said. Hickman and his family built a room on the side of their home for him to have a studio, he said. Not long after Hickman started creating images on wood, people began taking notice of his work, said Hickman's mother Jean Hickman. He sold his pieces at an art festival and is also a certified vendor for the Cherokee Nation. Hickman and his mother estimate that he has sold around 60 to 70 pieces. Jean Hickman said next year, her son will set up a booth to sell his goods at the Dogwood Festival. Hickman said he doesn't charge much for his work. Not long ago, Hickman received a large quantity of wood from the widow of artist Johnny Currey, he said. Currey also used wood as a medium but carved images into wood instead of burning them in, Hickman said. Hickman said he has made a special piece for Currey's widow but she has not yet come to pick it up. When he is not burning images into wood, he enjoys spending time with his son Braeden, 17, and daughter Addison, 15, who live in Springdale, he said. The future is up to God, said Brad Hickman. Jean Hickman said it has been a year-and-a-half since Brad Hickman's last surgery but he has since developed a tumor in his abdomen. "We have been very optimistic with the medical technology and the doctor that we have been blessed to see," Jean Hickman said. Brad Hickman sees Dr. Ali Krisht at Saint Vincent Arkansas Neuroscience Institute, Jean Hickman said. Having endured eight cranial surgeries, five transsphenoidal procedures, 43 proton radiation therapies and several gamma knife procedures, the family is grateful for all those who have prayed for her son, Jean Hickman said. "We are very appreciative of the prayer warriors to remember Brad," Jean Hickman said. "Our faith is very strong and we are trusting the Lord to see to any treatment he may have." Anyone wishing to purchase some of Hickman's work may call him at 479-957-1084, he said.  Print Headline: Man finds passion in creating art

         BELLA VISTA -- The Bella Vista Arts Council unveiled three new pieces of art Dec. 10 at the Bella Vista Public Library. Mayor Peter Christie told those gathered that this was the continuation of a journey that began in 2018 with the donation of the Marilyn Monroe sculpture. Now the city also has the firefly sculptures at the library and the "Journey Oz" mosaic mural at the Tweety Bird trailhead on Little Sugar Trail. Next year the city will get anywhere from seven to 10 pieces of public art, he said. "We concentrated on the infrastructure and got ahead of the game ... now it's time to have a bit of fun," he said. Mayor-elect John Flynn said he remembered when Christie told the City Council there was going to be an arts council advisory committee. "I had no idea it would be so dynamic," he said. He added many people would look back on Christie's term and remember fire stations, the public safety building and miles of new trails, but they should also remember the arts council. The first artist recognized during the event was Paige Dirksen of Bella Vista, who created a mural called "Whimsy" in the children's wing of the library. "My main goal was to create something playful and whimsical," she said, adding she also wanted the mural to be serene. "I enjoy working in abstract art because I enjoy hearing what the viewer sees in the art," she said. She said the color palette was one of the biggest challenges because she had to find colors that were playful but not too powerful. "I just loved talking to people and the kids that were watching -- you never know who you'll inspire," she said. She added she is grateful to live in an area that supports the arts in general. Next the group moved outdoors to the front of the library where a mosaic by Bella Vista artist Stevie Stevens called "Wheels in Motion" was installed. "I'm all about the movement of energy -- how we can change to be better people, have better community," she said. In addition to traditional mosaic materials such as pieces of mirrors and glass, the art piece incorporates bicycle parts. According to a press release, the bicycle parts were donated by Pedal It Forward and Mojo Cycling in Bentonville. Stevens said she has been a mosaic artist for 16 years and started doing the work professionally last year. "I live and breathe mosaic," she said. She said the piece took about a week -- 40 to 45 hours in the studio -- but added that speed comes with 16 years of experience. She said when she first started as an artist, the same piece would have taken her three times as long. The final piece, located in the garden, was a steel sculpture called "Mantis" by Northwest Arkansas artists Alex Cogbill and Paul Siebenthal. The bright yellow and orange sculpture bears two preying mantis images broken up into triangles. Cogbill said he is interested in geology and things in the world people don't normally see. He added that he and Siebenthal work a lot with geometry. "It was a fun piece to do," he said. Siebenthal said he is interested in the natural sciences and does a lot of metal work while keeping his hand in the sculptural world. He said for him, the triangular forms relate to the mantis head and the color palette relates to insect colors that communicate danger. Cogbill said, "We challenge each other a lot. We don't get offended. That's the fun part of a partnership." He said the art piece took two to two and a half months to create. He said Siebenthal hand drew each piece, and they used a computer to cut out the pieces with a plasma cutter. While the event was held on an overcast day, he noted, "When the sun shines through, you'll see shadows. It will really pop."  Print Headline: Beauty among the books

         HUNTSVILLE -- The Madison County Quorum Court has passed a resolution to issue bonds and collect a sales tax for construction of a new jail. Voters on Nov. 8 approved a 0.5% sales tax for a maximum $16.9 million bond issue to finance construction of a new jail and sheriff's office. But voters rejected a 1.25% sales tax to pay for maintenance and operation of the facility. County Judge Frank Weaver said the county will begin collecting the sales tax on April 1. Weaver said there will be more discussion before final decisions are made regarding the jail. He said a site has yet to be selected, and another sales tax could go before the public to pay for maintenance and operation of the facility. Weaver said it would cost about $16 million to build a 148-bed jail. He said a 0.5% sales tax would bring in about $1.1 million per year based on current collection rates. Weaver said the 0.5% tax would sunset when the bonds are paid off. The 1.25% tax would have been perpetual. According to the resolution, county officials are authorized to work with Friday, Eldredge & Clark LLP as bond counsel and Stephens Inc. as underwriter to prepared documents for the bond issue. If construction could start in 2024, Weaver said, the building could be in use by mid-2025. On three previous occasions, Madison County asked voters to approve a sales tax to help fund construction of a new jail or at least an addition to the existing jail. The tax proposals were rejected all three times. Luke Dotson, a member of the Quorum Court, said he thinks the county should scale back the proposal to a 75-bed jail. "The jail doesn't necessarily have to be as big as we first thought," he said. The county could then ask voters to approve a smaller tax for maintenance and operation, said Dotson. "A smaller jail just cuts the whole operations bill in half," he said. The 0.5% tax passed by voters on Nov. 8 didn't specify the size of the jail or number of beds. Dotson said Madison County has fewer than 17,000 residents, but it's considering a jail the size of counties' with twice the population. He said the county could build a smaller jail now, then go back to the voters later if more money is needed to expand the facility. Weaver said Madison County has between 40 and 60 inmates housed in other jails at any given time, and "we're releasing that many more who need to be in jail." "Why would you build a jail that doesn't even meet your needs now?" he said. "If you're going to build a facility, build it for 20 or 30 years down the road. Building costs are only going to increase as time goes on." Weaver said it would be difficult to get voters to approve another jail construction tax while they're paying the 0.5% approved by voters last month. In 2014, the state's 4th District Criminal Detention Facilities Review Committee found that the Madison County jail -- which was built in the early 1980s to accommodate eight beds -- didn't comply with state standards, so it was converted to a 24-hour holding facility. From 2015 until the end of 2021, Madison County's longer-term detainees were held in the Washington County jail -- 30 miles to the west in Fayetteville. But with that jail overcrowded, Washington County Sheriff Tim Helder ended the agreement. Since then, Madison County Sheriff Rick Evans has been housing his detainees at various jails around the state that have room. Besides the cost of paying other counties to house detainees, transportation has been a factor since some of the Madison County detainees are housed as far away as the Lafayette County jail in Lewisville, about 300 miles to the south. SouthBuild Team of Collierville, Tenn., has been consulting with Madison County on the proposed jail project. There will be some changes next month. Weaver is retiring after 12 years as county judge. Seven of the nine members of the Quorum Court will be new (Dotson lost his race for reelection). Weaver said the county will also have a new sheriff, county clerk, circuit clerk, treasurer, assessor and collector.  Print Headline: Madison County to collect tax for new jail

        The Maumelle Planning Commission plans to vote Thursday on changes to a previously approved events center that some residents have openly opposed – citing frustrations with lack of transparency and concerns for residents' future safety. Talks of expanding the events center follow a unanimous vote by the Maumelle City Council in January, which approved development plans for an events center that would host "weddings and small parties." If approved, the events center would sit in the middle of a plot of land located on the Maumelle Country Club property. Prior to 2020, the area was described as an "Open Space" plot in terms of land use and zone. Two years of conversations between the council and the planning commission eventually resulted in rezoning the area, allowing a developer to build residential property on the land. Since then, plans for the land have changed once again. Under the new development plan, parking capacity will jump from just over 300 allotted parking spots to nearly 500. Parking for the event center is said to be generated through a shared-parking agreement with the country club. The increase in approved square feet is unclear at this time. Maumelle residents argue that the increase in traffic and events in the area pose a danger to those currently living near the future development. One resident who requested not to be identified explained how residents in the neighborhood often walk the area late at night without worrying about heavy traffic or drivers unfamiliar with the area. She added that nearly every resident she's come into contact with has said they weren't aware of the plans for the events center or the center expansion. She also expressed that other residents are afraid there will be an increase in drunk drivers in their community following events hosted at the location. In an interview with an Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reporter, she noted that other residents have also complained about lack of information on the development, adding that many in the community, including those within the Maumelle Country Club, are not being told about what is to come. City Council Member Steve Mosley said, "It's become a bigger and bigger deal over time." He added, "The city did not publicize this well. [Residents] weren't even aware of the [initially approved] events center." Mosley added that only three notices of information have been sent out, one of them being to the country club, which caused the planning commission to defer the decision to late December. He reiterated that the commission might approve the increase in square feet, but that they did not seem comfortable with the suggested increase in parking capacity. Other concerns from both commission members and residents highlight the lack of road structure and access to the area of the event center. If the proposed expansion is approved by the commission, the motion for approval will then move to the council for vote. The commission's next meeting is planned for Dec. 22 at 6:30 p.m. at the Maumelle City Hall Council Chambers, 550 Edgewood Drive, Suite 590.

         Health care providers are urging Arkansans to get vaccinated against respiratory illnesses, including the flu and covid-19, ahead of the holidays. Jacqueline Truesdale, chief nursing officer of Mercy Northwest, said the Rogers hospital has been operating at or near capacity for a few weeks due to the number of patients struggling with respiratory illnesses. Mercy Fort Smith is experiencing a bed and staffing shortage caused by a high number of flu patients, according to Mardi Taylor, senior communications coordinator. Mercy Fort Smith also had nine hospitalized covid patients on Wednesday, including four in the intensive care unit, Taylor said. Increased vaccinations would help relieve the pressure, she said. Arkansas Center for Health Improvement, an independent health policy center, issued a joint news release with several Arkansas hospitals Wednesday, hoping to encourage flu shots before families get together. "Visits to Arkansas health care providers for the flu are exceptionally high," said Dr. Joe Thompson, president and chief executive officer of the center. "Flu season usually peaks in January or February, but we are already seeing a level of infections well above the highest average peak in the past five years." The level of respiratory virus cases at Washington Regional Medical Center has yet to exceed the capacity of the Fayetteville hospital, but the "tripledemic" of the flu, covid-19 and respiratory syncytial virus, known as RSV, could make for a challenging winter, President and CEO Larry Shackleford said in the release. "I urge everyone who is not vaccinated to get a flu shot now so upcoming holiday celebrations do not put you and your loved ones at risk," Ryan Gehrig, president of Mercy Hospitals Arkansas, said in the release. STATEWIDE FLU DATA Nineteen more people died because of influenza-related illness during the week ending Dec. 10, the highest weekly increase of the current flu season, according to the state Department of Health's latest report. Forty-eight of the state's 64 reported deaths since Oct. 2 were people who were not vaccinated, according to the department. Thirty deaths were reported during the entire 2021-22 flu season. The total of reported flu cases since Oct. 2 in Arkansas is more than 15,900, according to the state Health Department report. That number grew 1,700 the week ending Dec. 10 and 2,300 the previous week. Those increases were less than the increases of 2,400 and 2,500 seen during the two prior weeks from Nov. 13-26. About 14,800 cases were reported last flu season. Positive flu tests are reported by health care providers to the state Health Department's online database. Those numbers reflect only a portion of the state's total flu cases because not every infected person gets tested, according to the department. The number of visits to health care providers paid for by Medicaid and Arkansas Blue Cross and Blue Shield has surpassed the peak weekly average from the 2017-2022 period each of the last four weeks, according to department data. Flu antigen tests, which distinguish the type of flu virus, indicated 92% were influenza A and 8% were influenza B so far this season, the agency reported. Nationally, 7,300 deaths, 120,000 hospitalizations and at least 13 million illnesses from influenza have been reported this season, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Forty-five of the 48 contiguous states are reporting a high or very high activity of flu-like illness, according to the CDC. TRACKING A 'TRIPLEDEMIC' The spread of RSV seems to have peaked or plateaued recently, according to Dr. Marti Sharkey, pediatrician and public health officer for the city of Fayetteville. The CDC reported a decrease in detected RSV cases in the United States for four straight weeks between Nov. 13 and Dec. 10. Many health officials and providers have expected a more severe season than in previous years. The 2021-22 flu season was mild compared to flu seasons before the pandemic, according to the CDC. In the U.S., the flu was associated with an estimated 5,000 deaths, 100,000 hospitalizations and 9 million illnesses last flu season. Significantly fewer people have been exposed to flu over the last few years due to masking and social distancing measures, so fewer people have built up a natural immunity, according to Sharkey. Though flu seems to be the main driver of rising hospitalizations right now, covid infections and hospitalizations are rising as well, Sharkey said. The state Health Department reported 6,136 active cases of covid-19 in Arkansas on Thursday. About 6,000 cases have been reported by the department in the last two weeks, according to its online covid-19 dashboard. Benton and Washington counties had 468 and 444 active covid cases, respectively, as of Thursday, according to the department. Crawford and Sebastian counties had 118 and 251, respectively. Flu and covid infections can be difficult to compare because the reporting requirements vary, according to Sharkey. The stress flu can put on hospitals can be different than the strain experienced during the height of the covid-19 pandemic, she said. Generally, covid-19 put more stress on the infrastructure of medical facilities because covid units had to be isolated from other health units, she said. Both viruses continue to impact Arkansans 65 and older, she said. The group makes up the largest portion of the state's active covid-19 cases at 30%, according to the state Health Department. Nineteen flu outbreaks at Arkansas nursing homes and other congregate settings like jails and developmental disability centers have been reported since late October. Families should be careful to prevent transmitting flu or covid to their loved ones over the holidays, especially parents and grandparents, Sharkey said. The flu vaccine and covid booster do not prevent all illnesses, but both have been shown to be effective against the most severe impacts of the viruses, she said. "The best time to get a flu vaccine and covid booster is yesterday, but the second best day is today."  Print Headline: Hospitals seeing more flu patients, pushing some near capacity

         A fatal shooting Sunday in Little Rock led to the arrest of a 25-year-old man, a Little Rock Police Department post on Twitter says. Joshua Shorty was arrested as Arkansas State Police and Little Rock police investigated a shooting near the 12300 block of Chenal Parkway, the post says. Shorty has been charged with first-degree murder. The identity of the victim was not immediately released pending notification of next-of-kin, Mark Edwards, Little Rock police spokesman, said. Early Sunday, state police requested assistance from authorities in Little Rock with a homicide being investigated in Lonoke County, the post states. Little Rock police detectives who were notified of a shooting near the 12300 block of Chenal Parkway "determined the two incidents were the same and the homicide occurred in Little Rock," according to the post. Shorty is being held in the Pulaski County jail with no bond listed, an online inmate roster showed. Shorty also had a warrant for a failure to appear in North Little Rock, according to the roster.

         BENTONVILLE -- The geese have been run off from the Bentonville Municipal Airport, but there's now a different kind of wildlife causing some concern: a coyote. The coyote has been showing up occasionally at the airport and was last seen there about a month ago, said Robin Fields, the handler for Maverick, the airport's goose-chasing dog. The coyote isn't afraid of aircraft noise or humans, which leads Fields to believe the animal could have rabies. It has been seen standing on the runway and in the grassy areas around the airport. Pilots have also seen the coyote from the air, Fields said. The main concern is the coyote will get on the runway and be a danger to aircraft, said Debbie Griffin, city director of administration. "Hopefully he's moved on," she said. There are a couple of wooded areas west of the airport where the coyote could have come from, Fields said. As many as three coyotes wandered onto airport property 2 ½ years ago when Fields started working there, but this coyote is the only one seen in the last year, he said. Options for dealing with the animal are limited, Fields said. The city's animal control department doesn't have cages big enough to hold a coyote, he said. He also has left a message with the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission. Types of wildlife associated with safety issues at airports include birds, mammals and reptiles, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. Birds make up 97% of the reported strikes, mammals about 3% and reptiles less than 1%, according to the FAA. From 1990 to 2019, 1,210 civil aircraft were involved in collisions with deer, according to the FAA. Drake Field in Fayetteville on occasion sees deer and coyotes on the property, said Jared M. Rabren, airport director. "We have a wildlife mitigation program in place to help keep the majority of them at bay; however, some get through," he said. "We've got a project coming up in 2023 to address some of our older wildlife fencing, which should push those numbers even lower." Alex English with Northwest Arkansas National Airport in Highfill said there are no problems with large animals like a coyote getting on the runway. "We see deer around the property, but they tend to stay away from the noisy runway, and the runway is completely gated," she said. Coyotes are members of the canine family that includes wolves and foxes. They are native to Arkansas and can be found in all counties throughout the state. Coyotes usually weigh 25 to 35 pounds, according to the University of Arkansas' Division of Agriculture Research and Extension. According to the Game and Fish Commission, they are about the size of a small collie dog. They are reddish-gray and may appear to be a tall fox from a distance. A close encounter would reveal their yellow eyes and the typical black tip of their bushy tail. Coyotes are very intelligent with keen senses of sight, smell and hearing with a life span of 10 to 12 years. While coyotes are typically nocturnal predators living in bushy habitats, they are also opportunistic feeders that may find their way into urban neighborhoods.

         FORT SMITH -- The School Board has decided to dedicate a portion of covid money to building a permanent school-based health center, as current grant money ends in 2026 for the clinic now operated by the district. The center opened in 2021 as one of the district's Vision 2023 goals to provide increased access to health care for students, their families and staff. It's a freestanding, modular building between Darby Middle School and Tilles Elementary School at 1420 N. H St. The center is a partnership with Mercy Hospital and The Guidance Center and is paid for through a $542,000 grant from the Arkansas Division of Elementary and Secondary Education. Joseph Velasquez, a construction project manager for the district, said at a board meeting Monday the project was approved to use roughly $1.2 million in American Rescue Plan Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief money. He said the money was originally dedicated to add four classrooms to Ramsey Middle School, but due to construction costs and the current school population, that project has been reduced to two classrooms. Velasquez said the school has 830 students, and the highest forecasted population in the next 10 years is 935 students in the 2028-2029 school year. Shawn Shaffer, the district's executive director of facility operations, explained four classrooms were previously considered because the district's two grades with the largest population were at Ramsey at the time. He said the two largest are currently ninth and 10th, and both high schools were recently expanded as part of the Vision 2023 plan. School Board member Matt Blaylock asked if the district has any plans for the portable building the health center is currently housed in once the project is completed. Shaffer said it will probably be stored temporarily, and then used as a swing space as the district prepares for projects next summer. "I just want to say I think this is a good use of our resources, by allocating federal funds that have to be used within a certain time period for a project that we all agree is very worthwhile, so I think we're doing a very good job here," board member Dalton Person said. Kerri Tucker, the school-based health center coordinator, gave an overview of the clinic's past year of operation at the School Board meeting in October. She explained the center can be used by any district student, staff member and any family member residing in their home, but isn't open to the whole community. "By integrating into the educational environment, the School-Based Health Center contributes directly to the school's mission and delivers outcomes that matter to the educators," Tucker said. "We're able to help with reduction of absences, improve academic performance and decrease discipline problems." The school-based health center services include routine physical exams including sports physicals, diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic illness and minor injury. Tucker said the location of the center was chosen because many Darby and Tilles students come from low income families and/or are English language learners, which lead to barriers in receiving health care. She said in the first year of services, the center saw 1,198 people from 25 of the 26 district buildings. Scott Savage, an advanced practice registered nurse at Mercy, told the board the center has allowed him to aid the district and to build relationships with the patients. He said since the center provides access for people who might not otherwise receive health care, he's been able to help treat serious illnesses such diabetes and kidney disease. "I have to be able to motivate patients to be part of their health care," Savage said. "For somebody that was middle-aged that didn't want any part of taking care of themselves, to get them motivated is something I really take pride in." Rebecca Henson, a counselor at The Guidance Center, said working at the clinic has allowed her to collaborate with the district and Mercy to provide mental health services. "The goal is always to provide support, help deescalate situations and link them to the appropriate services," Henson said. "We've been able to help with students who might not want to have services at the school because they're intimidated or mental health services are taboo, so they'll come into the health clinic and meet us there. And the families, I guess they're less intimidated. Maybe they're frustrated with the school staff, and they don't feel heard. They can come in there and feel like they have a voice and have some support." Deputy Superintendent Marty Mahan said once the grant is up, the district will have to pay for personnel and maintenance for the center. He said the district would need to build a larger facility twice the size of the current facility at 3,360 square feet, and the proposed site would remain between Darby and Tilles.

         FORT SMITH -- City directors unanimously agreed to increase Mayor George McGill's salary by $20,000 a year during their meeting Tuesday. The ordinance makes the mayor's annual salary $30,000 per year and increases his vehicle allowance from $450 to $600 per month. A memo from City Director Carl Geffken to McGill and the directors noted the mayor's salary was established at $5,000 in 1971, four years after Fort Smith approved the city administrator form of government. He said an increase to $10,000 was approved in 1998. Ward 2 Director Andre' Good said McGill is an advocate for the state and the River Valley, especially Fort Smith. "Any nonprofit, any organization out there that has called on Mayor McGill to preside over a meeting, to give an award, to be at a church function, to be at a school function, you name the multitude of organizations here," he said. "These are people that expect him to be there individually and as groups, not just as the mayor of the city of Fort Smith." Ward 3 Director Lavon Morton said McGill has set a new standard as mayor. "I appreciate all the kind comments, but again, I agree this is about the future of Fort Smith," McGill said. "If we want to be a premiere city, we must act, look and sound like one. In 1967, the structure of what we paid our board members was set and gasoline was 25 cents a gallon. Cost of living has gone up eight times. It's about giving those that want to serve an opportunity to serve without it costing them to serve." "If we want to attract the caliber of people we want leading our city, that would be willing to give up their time, their knowledge and expertise to continue this city on a trajectory that we have not seen in years, you must do what is right by them," he added. The directors also approved salary increases for themselves in a 5-2 vote, with Directors Good, Lavon Morton, George Catsavis, Kevin Settle and Neal Martin voting for it, and Directors Jarred Rego and Robyn Dawson voting against. A memo from Geffken to the mayor and directors stated the ordinance would increase each director's salary from $1,000 to $7,800 per year, and increase the vehicle allowance from $400 to $600 per month. He said the salary was set at $1,000 in 1967 when Fort Smith approved its current form of government and has not changed since, he said. Rego made a motion to table approving the directors' salaries and establish a salary review committee in January. "As I've stated before, the time, effort and energy we put in has a higher value than the current $1,000 a year salary or even the proposed $7,800 a year salary, which actually doesn't even keep up with inflation," Rego said. "I just believe we must cautiously consider our course of action because how we choose to compensate ourselves as elected officials is a sensitive subject. "This board of directors is so committed to public engagement that we toured the city discussing the renewal of a 10-year-old tax funding essential services like parks, water and firefighters. Why wouldn't we want to press pause, broaden the conversation and engage a salary review committee made up of local citizens just like what was done in 1998 when the salary and compensation for the mayor and board of directors was discussed?" Dawson said the current salary is tied to the directors attending regular board meetings, and she wants the new salary tied to attendance at all director meetings including study sessions and annual strategic planning and budget meetings. "I know Director Catsavis has brought up many times over the years that I've been on the board that he thinks he deserves more money to sit on the board," Dawson said. "However, if the board feels like it's important to vote themselves without a vote of the people a raise of over 600%, it should be tied to all meetings." The motion to table the salary increase was denied by a 5-2 vote, with Rego and Dawson voting for and Good, Morton, Catsavis, Settle and Martin voting against.

         A scorching summer and inflation put the squeeze on Arkansas' Christmas tree crop this year, but demand for locally grown trees has remained high, farmers said. "We really had an insurgence of sales at covid and they have maintained," said Jim Lane, owner of Christmas Tree Lane farm near Ozark Thursday. "I think the boom was mostly that people wanted to get out of the house." The high sales came after dry summer months and a rise in the cost of herbicides and insecticides this year. While he didn't adjust his prices this year, Lane said he might have to during future seasons. Drought conditions cost Lane many of his seedlings, or young trees. To make up for the loss, Lane plans to plant around 1,500 trees next year -- or about 500 more than he would normally. While planting the extra seedlings won't be a significant expense, Lane said his Christmas tree crop in about five years will likely be thinner. The average growing time for a Christmas tree is seven years, but it can take as many as 15 or as few as four years for a tree to reach market size, according to the National Christmas Tree Association. Harold McAlpine, owner of McAlpine Christmas Tree Farm in Bismarck, lost around 200 marketable trees and roughly as many smaller trees to drought. "The biggest impact is the ones you put six years of work into having them ready to sell then you have no return on them," he said Thursday. Greg Eckart said he and his wife had to close Pine Grove Christmas Tree Farm a couple of weeks early after losing trees to drought. "We had a lot of trees die during the summer," he said. Eckart said he didn't raise prices at his farm in Charleston this year but noticed that inflation had driven up the cost of everything from insecticides to candy canes. "Candy canes have gone from $1 a box to $1.50," he said. P.D. Warford, who runs Papa Santa's Christmas Tree Farm on the outskirts of Benton, said rising costs had pressed him to slightly raise his tree prices. "This year I paid $650 for 1,000 pounds of triple 13 fertilizer," he said. "Two years ago ... that was less than $200." Inflation also posed a challenge for McAlpine this year, especially when it came to minimum wage increases. Following the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, McAlpine noticed people seemed willing to spend more on bigger trees and wreaths. While he figured demand may have slowed this year, he said it was hard to tell because of poor weather he had seen in recent weeks. "This has been some of the worst weather we've had through a selling season," he said. "At least half of our weekdays have been heavy rain, fog, drizzle. Very miserable weather." Jim Geisler, owner of Holiday Forest Christmas Tree Farm, said recent rainy weekends had also had a significant impact on his sales. "This is in some ways worse than the drought," he said. "A customer doesn't want to come out and get a wet tree normally." Despite the poor weather conditions, Geisler said he felt the demand for Christmas trees was still high. "I think if the weather is decent you're going to have good business," he said. "I don't think there's any slacking off of business with everything else equal." Nationwide, the demand for natural Christmas trees was expected to remain on par with last year's demand, according to a market forecast from the Real Christmas Tree Board. "The grower survey tells us demand is healthy," said Marsha Gray, executive director of the board, in a news release. "Retailers see steady consumer interest in real Christmas trees and right now supply is pretty well matched to that interest." All of the wholesale growers that responded to a survey from the board reported increased input costs. The biggest concerns for growers were supply chain slowdowns and the impact of inflation on consumer spending, according to the news release.  Print Headline: Christmas tree sales high in state

         BENTONVILLE -- A Benton County sheriff's deputy died Saturday morning during a motorcycle escort crash, according to a news release from the sheriff's office. Detective Paul Daniel Newell, 51, of Gravette was escorting the Wreaths Across America procession through Bentonville, the release states. Wreaths Across America provides wreaths to veterans cemeteries nationwide. The crash occurred about 6:30 a.m. Saturday at the intersection of Southeast Walton Boulevard and Southeast Metro Parkway, just west of the Interstate 49 interchange, according to a summary report on the state Department of Public Safety's website. Newell, on his motorcycle, was eastbound in the center turn lane of Walton Boulevard when he struck a curb, lost control and collided with an eastbound 2022 Freightliner truck, the report says. The driver of the Freightliner, who was not named in the report, was not injured. "I'm deeply saddened to learn Arkansas lost a member of the law enforcement family today in a tragic accident," Gov. Asa Hutchinson said in a tweet. "My prayers are with Benton County Deputy Paul Newell's family, the Benton County Sheriff's Office, and the law enforcement community." Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge said she was "heartbroken" for Newell, his family, the sheriff's office and the county, and she urged "all Arkansans to pray for them in this difficult time." "Our law enforcement officers leave their families for work and never know if that day will be their last," Rutledge said in a statement. "I cannot thank Detective Paul Newell enough for his over two decades of tireless service and sacrifice to his community and our state." Newell's death came just days after another Arkansas law enforcement officer was killed while on duty. Stuttgart police Sgt. Donald Scoby, 45, was fatally shot by a suspect during a chase that started Wednesday night, police said. The gunman, who also wounded a state police SWAT team member, was killed several hours later, on Thursday, during an exchange of gunfire with police, the state police said. Newell started his law enforcement career in the detention division with the sheriff's office on Dec. 1, 1998, and went on to graduate from the Arkansas Law Enforcement Training Academy, according to the sheriff's office news release. He served as a patrol deputy, patrol sergeant, training sergeant, lieutenant in the administration section and most recently a detective assigned to the Criminal Investigation Division. He was a certified instructor in numerous courses and placed a high emphasis on sharing his training and experience, the release states. Many people posted their condolences on Facebook. "This is a loss for the community in ways they can't understand," Michael McCranie, a former Benton County sheriff's deputy, said in a post. "Paul was a servant leader and dependable friend who loved his community deeply." "We will miss you buddy," Byron Frischman, another former deputy, wrote in a post. "You are in Gods hands now." Some posts were from other law enforcement agencies. "The Tontitown Police Department would like to express our sincerest condolences to the family, friends, co-workers, and colleagues of Detective Paul Newell with the Benton County Sheriff's Office," one post read. "May he rest in peace. We are praying for his family and friends during this most difficult time." "Our hearts and prayers are with the Newell family," a post on the Benton County sheriff's office Police Athletic League's Facebook page said. "Detective Paul Newell was an amazing man and poured his heart into the Sheriff's Office -- he was a great mentor to many. He will be missed but never forgotten." Walmart drivers participated Saturday as part of National Wreaths Across America Day. The drivers transported 100,000 wreaths across the country in honor of U.S. veterans in partnership with thousands of organizations and individuals, according to a Walmart news release. Walmart donated the services of 16 tractor-trailers and 100 truck drivers to transport the wreaths to participating cemeteries across the country, according to the release. "We're heartbroken about this tragic accident," a spokesperson for Walmart Stores Inc. said. "Our thoughts are with Deputy Paul Newell's loved ones. We value our partnerships with local law enforcement and will be cooperating with the investigation." Newell's body will be transported to the Arkansas State Crime Laboratory at 7 a.m. today, Lt. Shannon Jenkins, a spokeswoman for the sheriff's office, said. "We realize many of you will want to line the streets to honor his life," Jenkins said. All first responders can line up along Melissa Drive to I Street, she said.  Print Headline: Crash kills deputy for Benton County

         Arkansas State University students may soon be able to focus on certain themes in their general education classes, depending in part on results of a pilot program during the spring 2023 semester. General education courses are the core requirements for all degree programs, and the concept of themed work or teaching approaches within required courses is designed to provide new interest areas for students, according to the university. "Technology and society" and "creativity and problem solving" are the two themes for the pilot semester. "Technology and society" and "creativity and problem solving" were selected by faculty members from several other thematic possibilities, said David Harding, associate professor of political science and chairperson of the pilot study committee. He added that the themes should prove attractive to students. A dozen faculty members from seven different departments will participate in the spring pilot, and Harding said he expects more than 400 students to take part. Some of those students will have done so intentionally, while others will "just wind up there" because they selected courses that are part of the pilot for any number of reasons, he said. "They might need that class to graduate, or it fits into their schedule, or they like the professor, or they're interested in the course," he said. Feedback from students and faculty members in the pilot courses will inform plans for the fall, when the current plan is to add two more themes, he said. "This could change, but it's likely the two will be 'diversity and globalization' and 'health and well-being,'" he said. Eventually, up to eight different themes -- such as "the Natural State and its cultures" -- could be offered, he said. "We're not changing the whole general education program; [rather], it's like a vending machine in a cafeteria, with 50 different buttons -- some people just want a plain Coke, but others want cherry Coke or vanilla Coke." If a student excels in, say, creativity and problem solving, and is intent on a career that utilizes those skills, the student may want to chart that course through general education classes, he said. Eventually, students who complete a certain amount of general education courses under a select theme could receive recognition for it, such as a line on their transcript, a certificate or even a cord at commencement. The thematic approach should make these classes "more attractive" for students, said Chancellor Todd Shields. "It's still the core concepts but packaged in a way kids like." Plans to revamp the general education model began in 2019 because the general education program "doesn't have a real identity on campus," and many students view those courses as "a hurdle, not an opportunity," Harding said. The themes idea was "the one that stuck" out of various changes suggested, and "there will be a lot of project-based learning" for students under the thematic approach. "I hope the students are as excited about these courses as the professors are," Harding said. "We see this as a great recruiting tool for the university, and we think it'll help with retention, because students who see these classes as something they want to do -- rather than have to do -- will want to be [in class] and make better grades." The state requires these core courses, "and I believe in" them, but colleges have done a poor job explaining to students -- especially those who already know what they want to study and do for their careers -- why general education classes are necessary, Shields said. Math majors may wonder why they have to take an art class, and theater majors wonder why they need to take a science course, for example, but general education courses build "critical thinkers and leaders," and that will only be enhanced by the thematic approach. Incorporating themes into general education classes will benefit both students and teachers, Harding said. "It'll be easier for students to see how [these concepts] are related, and faculty will collaborate more, instead of me being in this building, doing my own thing, and you in another building, doing your own thing." The thematic courses are taught by faculty members who have volunteered to participate in the pilot program, Harding said. This summer, faculty members will again have a chance to sign up for thematic courses for the fall 2023 semester, and they are paid a stipend for making these alterations to their courses.

         Though the law schools at Yale and Harvard -- both fixtures at or near the top of U.S. News & World Report's annual list of best law schools -- have announced they will no longer submit data for the rankings, neither of Arkansas' two law schools have decided to do likewise. This is "a complex issue," with reasonable parties on both sides making fair points about the rankings and retreating from the rankings, said Cynthia Nance, dean of the University of Arkansas School of Law in Fayetteville. She said it would not be "a unilateral decision by me," adding that faculty, the provost and chancellor, among others, would be consulted. Nance said she would rather work on reforming the U.S. News rankings to make them a better tool for assessing law schools and noted that even though law schools like Harvard and Yale have denounced the rankings, they will still appear in them, with U.S. News using data that is publicly accessible to rank them. The decision by Harvard and Yale "seems to have had a snowball effect," with several other highly ranked law schools -- including Duke and Stanford -- also announcing they will no longer participate in the U.S. News rankings, and "I understand where they're coming from," said Theresa Beiner, dean of the University of Arkansas at Little Rock William H. Bowen School of Law. "It's very interesting that these schools have come out now to make this statement, and I do think U.S. News is listening." In November, deans at both Yale, which topped the most-recent U.S. News rankings of best law schools, and Harvard, which was ranked in a tie for fourth best law school, announced they would no longer be participating in the annual list, criticizing the publication's methodology and arguing that the list actively perpetuates disparities in law schools. "U.S. News stands in the way of progress for legal education and the profession," Heather K. Gerken, dean of Yale Law School, told The Chronicle of Higher Education. "It's made it harder for law schools to admit and support low-income students, and it's undermining efforts to launch a generation to serve." "We share, and have expressed to U.S. News, the concern that their debt metric ignores school-funded loan forgiveness programs in calculating student debt. Such loan forgiveness programs assist students who pursue lower paying jobs, typically in the public interest sector," John Manning, dean of Harvard Law School, said in a statement posted on the school's website. U.S. News has defended the rankings, with the publication noting it provides metrics and information so students can make educated choices about law schools. U.S. News aims to aid consumers in selecting a school, "but I don't think they realized" the extent to which some schools have gone in order to raise their rankings, said Beiner, the first non-interim female dean at the UALR law school. The rankings are meant to provide "helpful information," but they can also serve as a "blunt instrument that doesn't tell the whole story for how someone should choose a law school." Beiner, who will leave the dean's job effective July 1, 2023, and return to a faculty position, is currently discussing with her faculty whether the Bowen School of Law should follow Harvard, Yale and others out of the U.S. News rankings or continue to participate, she said. "It will be a faculty decision," and based on early feedback, it seems a majority would prefer the latter option, "but I haven't heard from that many, yet." The Bowen School's place in the U.S. News rankings is not among Beiner's highest priorities -- "it's a game, and, in a lot of ways, an expensive game -- [but] we do pay attention to it, [because] it does matter to some of our faculty and our alumni," she said. "We have an ad-hoc committee" focused on the rankings, and "if there are easy things we can do to [help our ranking], we do them, but it's not a huge deal for us." The Bowen School surveys its incoming students, and the U.S. News ranking "is just not among the things they care about," she said. They choose Bowen because "of cost, location and our core values." The law school at UA-Fayetteville was tied for 86th in the latest U.S. News law school rankings, while the Bowen School of Law ranked with several other schools in the 147-192 range. CRITICISMS OF RANKINGS Deans at Harvard and Yale posit that the rankings actively discourage law schools from providing aid by placing heavy emphasis on the Law School Admission Test and Graduate Record Examination scores, as well as grade-point averages, which pressures schools to turn down promising students who may not have been able to afford test preparation courses. They also said it pushes schools to deploy financial aid on students with high scores, rather than based on financial need, and they argue that the rankings punish colleges when students opt for public-interest careers or elect to pursue Ph.D. and master's degrees. Beiner shares many of those concerns about the rankings, and she has shared her perspective with representatives of U.S. News, as the rankings don't reflect "a lot of what we're focused on" at the Bowen School of Law, she said. For example, the U.S. News rankings do not account for the fact that the Bowen School has a Center for Racial Justice and Criminal Justice Reform. Law schools intent on making law careers "accessible," those focusing on underserved communities and diverse law schools also do not benefit in the U.S. News rankings, said Nance, who is serving as dean while the U of A conducts a national search for the next law school dean. "Looking at underserved" populations -- from first-generation college students to students from minority groups to students from low-income households -- and "what percentage of your graduates go into public-interest [careers] or serve underserved communities, those are some [changes] I think would make the rankings better," Nance said. There is also a "reputation" element to the rankings -- 40% of a law school's ranking depends on reputation surveys U.S. News sends to law academics and professionals -- which hurts schools that "aren't as well-known," Nance said. While law schools at places like Harvard and Yale enjoy wide name recognition, someone in Colorado may not even know about law schools at UALR or UA-Fayetteville. EXPENSES AND TUITION The rankings also credit schools for how much they spend on students, a metric that hurts public schools, and some schools engage in creative billing practices to boost their rankings, Nance said. The rankings "have driven a lot of things that shouldn't be a priority for a legal education." As "a state school reliant on state funding, we can't compete with" private institutions like Harvard, Yale and others that benefit from massive endowments, substantial private gifts and high tuition, Beiner said. "We try to keep tuition low to make our law school accessible [and to] provide our students options when they graduate. We have a wide range of students, from first-generation college graduates to our 'Bowen Families,'" whose parents or siblings also attended Bowen. The UA-Fayetteville School of Law "is a Best Value law school, and we want to continue that for access to the profession," said Nance, who also served as dean from 2006-2011. "We have an admissions committee that looks at anything we might want to change in our standards, but we have a pretty holistic policy" for admissions. "It's important to serve all communities in Arkansas" -- the state ranks near the bottom in America for fewest number of lawyers per capita -- "and make sure they are well-served by lawyers," Beiner said. Diversity is also a "win-win" within a law school, because students meet individuals unlike themselves, and "they're going to have clients who are different from them" in their careers. And graduates should be able to choose jobs based on desire, fit and passion, rather than solely on salary, she said. However, if they have a mountain of student debt, they may have to make the latter choice, which is why the Bowen school attempts to keep tuition and fees manageable. Beiner knows from experience, as after graduating law school at Northwestern University she was offered an alluring position with the U.S. Department of Justice in Washington, D.C., but due to her student debt she felt she had to accept a role with the San Francisco law firm of Howard, Rice, Nemerovski, Canady, Falk & Rabkin -- where she worked until joining the Bowen School of Law in 1994 -- because of the higher salary, she said. "It's key for us to give students options" after graduating law school. DEBATE OVER LSAT The LSAT has become a particular bone of contention -- for the U.S. News rankings and for law school admissions generally -- with some arguing it aids individuals who might be traditionally overlooked by prestigious law schools, because they can gain attention with outstanding scores, Nance said. On the other hand, like many standardized tests, the LSAT can benefit the wealthy who can pay for pre-test and study materials. The mean LSAT score for white test-takers was 11.5 points higher than the mean score for Black test-takers from 2017-2018, according to the Law School Admission Council, which administers the LSAT. The Council's 2022 report also suggested disparities between whites and other minority test-takers. American Bar Association standards currently require law schools to use a "valid and reliable test" in admissions decisions, and for years the only standardized test that automatically met that criteria was the LSAT. But the American Bar Association added the GRE as an acceptable alternative in 2021, according to Reuters. In November, however, the Council of the Section of Legal Education and Admissions, a part of the American Bar Association that accredits U.S. law schools, voted to eliminate the long-standing requirement that schools use the LSAT or other standardized test when admitting students. The rule change will go before the American Bar Association's House of Delegates, the organization's policy making body, in February. The rule change could take effect in the fall of 2025. The House, which has two opportunities to reject any proposed changes to the law school accreditation standards before they become final, quashed a similar proposal in 2018. The Bowen School has very simple criteria for admitting students, Beiner said. "'Do we think they will be successful in law school?' I don't see us changing that, because our students do well -- they pass the bar, and they get jobs."  Print Headline: State law schools join debate about rankings

         A man and woman have been been arrested on murder charges after the body of the woman's 6-year-old son was found buried below a hallway floor inside a Lee County home Friday night, the Arkansas State Police said in a news release. State police special agents are also investigating scalp burns suffered by Ashley Roland's 6 year-old daughter, who also lived at the home in the Moro community west of Marianna, according to the release. Agents of the state police Criminal Investigation Division were called by Lee County sheriff's deputies to the home about 10:45 p.m Friday. Roland, 28, and Nathan Bridges, 33, were arrested on charges of capital murder, abuse of a corpse, tampering with physical evidence and endangering the welfare of a minor, the release says. They were being held in the Lee County jail on Saturday. Based on their initial investigation, state police agents believe the boy died from injuries suffered in the home, possibly three months ago. The state medical examiner will determine the manner and cause of death. Roland's daughter was taken to a Memphis hospital, where she was in stable condition.

         The newest member of the Grand Ole Opry is a native of Mammoth Springs, scored a breakout hit in 2018 with "Girl Goin' Nowhere" and might have more tattoos than most other Opry members combined. We're talking about Ashley McBryde, of course, and on Dec. 10, the singer-songwriter was inducted into the Opry in Nashville, Tenn., by her pal and hero, Terri Clark. The 39-year-old called it "the biggest night of my life." Her invitation to become part of the Opry came as a surprise. On Oct. 6, she was being interviewed on the "CBS Mornings" program when Garth Brooks showed up during her segment from the Opry House and invited her to join. During a pre-induction news conference, McBryde talked about visiting the Opry when she was 12 with her mom as part of a bluegrass event. They met up with some musician friends and got a behind-the-scenes tour of the Opry. She also stood on the Opry stage, where she played "Pea-Pickin' Time in Georgia" on a borrowed guitar for her mom and their friends. "That was my first time to come to the Opry," she said. "I ate a Tootsie Pop and we went back to the hotel." Growing up, McBryde attended shows at the Opry and saw acts like The Whites and Ricky Skaggs. She made her official Opry debut on June 16, 2017, and has performed there more than 20 times. At her induction, with family and more than 4,000 fans in attendance, McBryde of course played "Girl Goin' Nowhere," the song that was inspired by a teacher who once told McBryde that her dream of moving to Nashville to write songs was "stupid." "I wrote that song in hopes of playing the Opry someday," she said during the news conference. She also invited early supporter, friend and fellow Nashville rebel Eric Church to perform "Bible and a .44," a song from her 2016 album "Jalopies and Expensive Guitars." It was a thank-you to Church, who in 2017 brought McBryde on stage to play the song during a concert at Allstate Arena in Chicago. "That was the first time I'd played in a stadium, used in-ear monitors or seen 19,000 people in one room," she said. It's been a busy and fruitful few months for McBryde, who often became emotional during her news conference. Her album, "Ashley McBryde Presents: Lindeville," was released on Sept. 30 and has earned raves from not just country corners but also from outlets like Esquire and NPR. Last month, McBryde and Carly Pearce won a CMA award for Musical Event of the Year for their song "Never Wanted to Be That Girl" and she's nominated in two categories at the 65th annual Grammy Awards -- Best Country Album for "Ashley McBryde Presents: Lindeville" and with Pearce for Best Country Duo/Group Performance for "Never Wanted to Be That Girl." email: sclancy@adgnewsroom.com  Print Headline: McBryde joins Opry, is thrilled

         State charter panel endorses renewals The state's Charter Authorizing Panel last week endorsed extending the state-issued charters of several open-enrollment charter schools. The panel's recommendations on the charter renewals now go to the Arkansas Board of Education for final action. The panel approved: eStem Public Charter Schools with five campuses in Little Rock and an enrollment cap of 3,844 for a 10-year renewal with a report to the state in three years, along with a three-year waiver of state rules to provide for the system's digital learning program. Friendship Aspire Academies of Arkansas with campuses in Little Rock and Pine Bluff and an enrollment cap of 2,285 for a 10-year renewal. KIPP Delta Public Schools with campuses in Helena-West Helena and Blytheville and an enrollment cap of 2,600 for a five-year renewal. Premier High Schools of Arkansas with campuses in Little Rock, Fort Smith, Texarkana and online -- with an enrollment cap of 600 -- for a five-year renewal. Two district boards select new leaders Two school boards in Pulaski County have new presidents for the coming year. The Little Rock School Board late Thursday selected Michael Mason to be its president for the next year. Mason, an equal-opportunity specialist for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Office of Fair Housing, succeeds Greg Adams in the president's position. While no longer president, Adams remains on the Little Rock School Board. He was reelected to the board last month. Mason, 64, is a graduate of Little Rock Central. He has a bachelor's degree in political science from the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff and a master's degree in management and public administration from Webster University. Earlier in the week, Stephen Delaney was selected to be president of the School Board for the Pulaski County Special School District. Delaney, 41, attended district schools, graduating from Mills University Studies High School. He has a bachelor's degree in government and works in information technology and engineering for KVTN, which is a Christian-programming television station in Arkansas. He represents the district's Zone 1, which encompasses all or parts of Landmark, Shannon Hills and Alexander in southwestern Pulaski County as well as a bit of Saline County, and the west Little Rock neighborhoods of Woodlands Edge, Brodie Creek, Cherry Creek and Spring Valley. Delaney replaces Lindsey Gustafson in the leadership role. Gustafson lost her bid for election last month to Wendy Potter. Educators honored with Impact Award The Arkansas School for Mathematics, Sciences and the Arts in Hot Springs recently recognized educators from across the state with its annual Teacher Impact Award. The award honors educators who helped shape and influence incoming students. Students nominated teachers who aided their growth both intellectually and emotionally. There were more than 100 teachers nominated for recognition. Every educator who was nominated received a certificate of recognition. A letter highlighting their recognition also was sent to each educator's principal. A committee of Arkansas School for Mathematics, Sciences and the Arts staff members read through the recommendations to give further recognition to five educators from different regions within the state. The educators who received that additional recognition are: Heather James of Camden Fairview High School; Seth Jernigan of eStem Junior High School in Little Rock; Matthew Kalkbrenner of White Hall High School; Tara Parra, a former middle school teacher at Decatur Middle School; and Robin Sneed of Blytheville High School. Six schools named Samsung finalists The Samsung company has named six Arkansas schools as state finalists in the 13th annual Samsung Solve for Tomorrow STEM competition. Each state finalist will receive a package of $2,500 in technology and school supplies. The Arkansas schools are: Beebe Junior High School in Beebe. Lakeside High School in Hot Springs. Central High School in Little Rock. Helen Tyson Middle School in Springdale. Hellstern Middle School in Springdale. Lakeside Junior High School in Springdale. The state finalists will advance to additional stages of the national competition, which will culminate in three schools being selected in May as National Winners and receive $100,000 prize packages. City Year sponsors drive for donations City Year Little Rock is asking the community to make a gift that gives back with its Sponsor a Red Jacket campaign. The stocking stuffer donations, ranging from $10 to $150, will support the nonprofit's AmeriCorps members as they provide Central Arkansas students with academic, emotional and social skills for long-term success. Interested individuals may contribute at https://tinyurl.com/bdfbubb5. "Now, perhaps more than ever, students are counting on our AmeriCorps members for support, whether for one-on-one tutoring or simply a compassionate listening ear," said Jennifer Cobb, senior vice president and executive director. "These end-of-year donations are crucial to advancing our efforts to help children thrive, both in and out of the classroom." City Year is part of the AmeriCorps national service network. Teams of City Year AmeriCorps members are full-time tutors and mentors in four Little Rock School District schools: Mabelvale Elementary, Stephens Elementary, Cloverdale Middle, and J.A. Fair K-8 Preparatory School.  Print Headline: Education Notebook

         LITTLE ROCK -- The School Board for the Pulaski County Special School District on Tuesday sent a teacher-generated request for a $600 bonus back to its personnel policies committee for further study. The vote was unanimous at the meeting in which Stephen Delaney was selected by his colleagues as president. Tuesday's meeting was the first for Wendy Potter, who was elected last month in a contested race with former board president Lindsey Gustafson. Brenda Robinson, chairman of the personnel committee for certified employees, had asked that the board accept the plan for a $600 bonus for the district's more than 1,050 state licensed teachers at a cost of $774,900 that included benefits. Several board members, who had the option of accepting, rejecting, sending back for study, or tabling the request for a month, said they would prefer that the personnel committee develop a plan for employee raises. Those raises would have a greater long-term benefit for the employees compared to a one-time bonus. The board on Tuesday rejected a $600 bonus request from the classified personnel policies committee over the objections of Emry Chesterfield, who is chairman of that committee that represents support staff.

         Though the law schools at Yale and Harvard -- both fixtures at or near the top of U.S. News & World Report's annual list of best law schools -- have announced they will no longer submit data for the rankings, neither of Arkansas' two law schools have decided to do likewise. This is "a complex issue," with reasonable parties on both sides making fair points about the rankings and retreating from the rankings, said Cynthia Nance, dean of the University of Arkansas School of Law in Fayetteville. She said it would not be "a unilateral decision by me," adding that faculty, the provost and chancellor, among others, would be consulted. Nance said she would rather work on reforming the U.S. News rankings to make them a better tool for assessing law schools and noted that even though law schools like Harvard and Yale have denounced the rankings, they will still appear in them, with U.S. News using data that is publicly accessible to rank them. The decision by Harvard and Yale "seems to have had a snowball effect," with several other highly ranked law schools -- including Duke and Stanford -- also announcing they will no longer participate in the U.S. News rankings, and "I understand where they're coming from," said Theresa Beiner, dean of the University of Arkansas at Little Rock William H. Bowen School of Law. "It's very interesting that these schools have come out now to make this statement, and I do think U.S. News is listening." In November, deans at both Yale, which topped the most-recent U.S. News rankings of best law schools, and Harvard, which was ranked in a tie for fourth best law school, announced they would no longer be participating in the annual list, criticizing the publication's methodology and arguing that the list actively perpetuates disparities in law schools. "U.S. News stands in the way of progress for legal education and the profession," Heather K. Gerken, dean of Yale Law School, told The Chronicle of Higher Education. "It's made it harder for law schools to admit and support low-income students, and it's undermining efforts to launch a generation to serve." "We share, and have expressed to U.S. News, the concern that their debt metric ignores school-funded loan forgiveness programs in calculating student debt. Such loan forgiveness programs assist students who pursue lower paying jobs, typically in the public interest sector," John Manning, dean of Harvard Law School, said in a statement posted on the school's website. U.S. News has defended the rankings, with the publication noting it provides metrics and information so students can make educated choices about law schools. U.S. News aims to aid consumers in selecting a school, "but I don't think they realized" the extent to which some schools have gone in order to raise their rankings, said Beiner, the first non-interim female dean at the UALR law school. The rankings are meant to provide "helpful information," but they can also serve as a "blunt instrument that doesn't tell the whole story for how someone should choose a law school." Beiner, who will leave the dean's job effective July 1, 2023, and return to a faculty position, is currently discussing with her faculty whether the Bowen School of Law should follow Harvard, Yale and others out of the U.S. News rankings or continue to participate, she said. "It will be a faculty decision," and based on early feedback, it seems a majority would prefer the latter option, "but I haven't heard from that many, yet." The Bowen School's place in the U.S. News rankings is not among Beiner's highest priorities -- "it's a game, and, in a lot of ways, an expensive game -- [but] we do pay attention to it, [because] it does matter to some of our faculty and our alumni," she said. "We have an ad-hoc committee" focused on the rankings, and "if there are easy things we can do to [help our ranking], we do them, but it's not a huge deal for us." The Bowen School surveys its incoming students, and the U.S. News ranking "is just not among the things they care about," she said. They choose Bowen because "of cost, location and our core values." The law school at UA-Fayetteville was tied for 86th in the latest U.S. News law school rankings, while the Bowen School of Law ranked with several other schools in the 147-192 range. CRITICISMS OF RANKINGS Deans at Harvard and Yale posit that the rankings actively discourage law schools from providing aid by placing heavy emphasis on the Law School Admission Test and Graduate Record Examination scores, as well as grade-point averages, which pressures schools to turn down promising students who may not have been able to afford test preparation courses. They also said it pushes schools to deploy financial aid on students with high scores, rather than based on financial need, and they argue that the rankings punish colleges when students opt for public-interest careers or elect to pursue Ph.D. and master's degrees. Beiner shares many of those concerns about the rankings, and she has shared her perspective with representatives of U.S. News, as the rankings don't reflect "a lot of what we're focused on" at the Bowen School of Law, she said. For example, the U.S. News rankings do not account for the fact that the Bowen School has a Center for Racial Justice and Criminal Justice Reform. Law schools intent on making law careers "accessible," those focusing on underserved communities and diverse law schools also do not benefit in the U.S. News rankings, said Nance, who is serving as dean while the U of A conducts a national search for the next law school dean. "Looking at underserved" populations -- from first-generation college students to students from minority groups to students from low-income households -- and "what percentage of your graduates go into public-interest [careers] or serve underserved communities, those are some [changes] I think would make the rankings better," Nance said. There is also a "reputation" element to the rankings -- 40% of a law school's ranking depends on reputation surveys U.S. News sends to law academics and professionals -- which hurts schools that "aren't as well-known," Nance said. While law schools at places like Harvard and Yale enjoy wide name recognition, someone in Colorado may not even know about law schools at UALR or UA-Fayetteville. EXPENSES AND TUITION The rankings also credit schools for how much they spend on students, a metric that hurts public schools, and some schools engage in creative billing practices to boost their rankings, Nance said. The rankings "have driven a lot of things that shouldn't be a priority for a legal education." As "a state school reliant on state funding, we can't compete with" private institutions like Harvard, Yale and others that benefit from massive endowments, substantial private gifts and high tuition, Beiner said. "We try to keep tuition low to make our law school accessible [and to] provide our students options when they graduate. We have a wide range of students, from first-generation college graduates to our 'Bowen Families,'" whose parents or siblings also attended Bowen. The UA-Fayetteville School of Law "is a Best Value law school, and we want to continue that for access to the profession," said Nance, who also served as dean from 2006-2011. "We have an admissions committee that looks at anything we might want to change in our standards, but we have a pretty holistic policy" for admissions. "It's important to serve all communities in Arkansas" -- the state ranks near the bottom in America for fewest number of lawyers per capita -- "and make sure they are well-served by lawyers," Beiner said. Diversity is also a "win-win" within a law school, because students meet individuals unlike themselves, and "they're going to have clients who are different from them" in their careers. And graduates should be able to choose jobs based on desire, fit and passion, rather than solely on salary, she said. However, if they have a mountain of student debt, they may have to make the latter choice, which is why the Bowen school attempts to keep tuition and fees manageable. Beiner knows from experience, as after graduating law school at Northwestern University she was offered an alluring position with the U.S. Department of Justice in Washington, D.C., but due to her student debt she felt she had to accept a role with the San Francisco law firm of Howard, Rice, Nemerovski, Canady, Falk & Rabkin -- where she worked until joining the Bowen School of Law in 1994 -- because of the higher salary, she said. "It's key for us to give students options" after graduating law school. DEBATE OVER LSAT The LSAT has become a particular bone of contention -- for the U.S. News rankings and for law school admissions generally -- with some arguing it aids individuals who might be traditionally overlooked by prestigious law schools, because they can gain attention with outstanding scores, Nance said. On the other hand, like many standardized tests, the LSAT can benefit the wealthy who can pay for pre-test and study materials. The mean LSAT score for white test-takers was 11.5 points higher than the mean score for Black test-takers from 2017-2018, according to the Law School Admission Council, which administers the LSAT. The Council's 2022 report also suggested disparities between whites and other minority test-takers. American Bar Association standards currently require law schools to use a "valid and reliable test" in admissions decisions, and for years the only standardized test that automatically met that criteria was the LSAT. But the American Bar Association added the GRE as an acceptable alternative in 2021, according to Reuters. In November, however, the Council of the Section of Legal Education and Admissions, a part of the American Bar Association that accredits U.S. law schools, voted to eliminate the long-standing requirement that schools use the LSAT or other standardized test when admitting students. The rule change will go before the American Bar Association's House of Delegates, the organization's policy making body, in February. The rule change could take effect in the fall of 2025. The House, which has two opportunities to reject any proposed changes to the law school accreditation standards before they become final, quashed a similar proposal in 2018. The Bowen School has very simple criteria for admitting students, Beiner said. "'Do we think they will be successful in law school?' I don't see us changing that, because our students do well -- they pass the bar, and they get jobs."  Print Headline: State law schools debate rankings

         GREENWOOD -- The city is trying to figure out how to move forward with a splash pad project after receiving a state grant to bring it to fruition. Casey Craig, city parks director, told the city Parks and Water/Wastewater commissions at a joint study session Monday the Arkansas Department of Parks, Heritage and Tourism selected the city to receive a 50-50 matching grant for the project totaling $239,278. He added this came with the condition the project be completed within two years from the date of the award notice. "If we're going to use this money, we got to get the ball rolling on this project," Craig said. The City Council approved applying for the grant to build the splash pad in April. Tammy Briley, the city's parks director at the time, said she intended to apply for the maximum allowable amount, $250,000, with assistance from the Western Arkansas Planning and Development District. Mayor Doug Kinslow expressed gratitude to both Briley and the district for the parts they played in securing the grant for Greenwood, along with excitement for the award itself. He estimated the city has been discussing how to develop a splash pad for at least 15 years. Kinslow said a splash pad would give children a new, readily accessible water feature allowing them to have fun in the summer for free. He acknowledged while some of the children can get to the nearby Fort Smith and Parrot Island, a water park the city jointly owns with Sebastian County, many others can't. "This is something that the kids, any kid, could go and enjoy, and we're excited about giving the kids that opportunity," he said. Craig said the splash pad project will be built within about 19 acres adjacent to Bell Park. The project, which is in the design phase without a time to start construction, is set to include a splash pad, two restrooms and a parking lot with 20 spaces. The council approved buying the land to expand Bell Park in November 2019. The land came with a purchase price not to exceed $10,000 per acre for a total of $194,700. Kinslow said the splash pad will be the first amenity to be built on the property. A budget dated Aug. 22 puts the splash pad project's price at more than $1.01 million between construction costs and other expenses. MAHG Architecture in Fort Smith has been designing the project while the Van Buren-based Hawkins-Weir Engineers is handling "most of the utility side of the engineering" for it, according to Craig. Craig said Monday's joint commission meeting was meant to get everybody involved in the splash pad project together to discuss work that's been done so far, as well as how to best proceed. One discussion topic was the type of system the city will use to get water to and from the splash pad, as well as what each option would require from the city. Craig explained one possible system would send water to the splash pad and use drains in the ground to catch the water after the pad shoots it out. The water would then pass through the city's sewer system to a wastewater treatment facility. "The second type is a recirculation system, and it's more or less the same process," Craig said. "Water is sent to the splash pad, a drain catches it, but instead of going to our sewer system, this water is sent into a recirculation system contained inside the splash pad premises and re-used for splash pad water." Craig said he'll work to contact other municipalities in the area, such as Fort Smith, to learn details about how they facilitate their splash pads. Another element discussed at the meeting was how the city will pay for the splash pad project between sales tax money available for parks projects and a possible loan in tandem with the state grant. Joel Goldstein, Parks Commission chairman, said the city Advertising & Promotion Commission may also contribute money for the project. Tom Marsh, city finance director, said the council would need to approve any loan in connection with the project. A loan would free up city sales tax money to be used for park projects outside the splash pad going forward. Craig asked the Parks Commission members to go through the project budget and select which areas they believed could be pared down to reduce the overall cost before their next meeting Tuesday , when they will discuss the budget again in greater detail. "We need to get construction plans from MAHG so that our water guys know where they can start running water," Craig said.  Sales and Use Tax Greenwood has a total 9.5% sales tax rate. This includes 6.5% state sales tax, 2% city sales tax and 1% county sales tax. Of the citys 2%, 1% is dedicated to water and sewer, .25% is dedicated to bond payments for a traffic relief project in the city with the Arkansas Department of Transportation and .75% is divided equally between three city departments. This includes the fire, street and parks departments, who each receive .25%.

         Saving whales is probably a good way to save the planet, according to a group of scientists who examined the animals' potential to act as a carbon sink -- something that helps reduce carbon in the Earth's atmosphere by absorbing more carbon than it releases. Many nature-based solutions to fighting climate change have focused on the ability of trees and wetlands to capture and store atmospheric carbon dioxide. But in a paper published Thursday in the journal Trends in Ecology and Evolution, a group of biologists explores the idea that whales can influence the amount of carbon in the air and in the ocean, potentially contributing to the overall reduction of atmospheric carbon dioxide. "Understanding the role of whales in the carbon cycle is a dynamic and emerging field that may benefit both marine conservation and climate-change strategies," wrote the authors, led by Heidi Pearson, a biologist from the University of Alaska Southeast. The ocean is by far the world's largest carbon sink, having absorbed about 40% of all carbon dioxide emitted from the burning of fossil fuels since the Industrial Revolution. Marine biologists recently discovered that whales, particularly great whales, also play an important role in capturing carbon from the atmosphere. They can weigh up to 28 tons and live more than 100 years, the researchers wrote, and their size and long lives mean they accumulate more carbon in their bodies than other small animals. When they die, they sink to the bottom of the ocean, taking carbon out of the atmosphere for centuries. "Whales consume up to 4 percent of their massive body weight in krill and photosynthetic plankton every day. For the blue whale, this equates to nearly 8,000 pounds," the scientists wrote. "When they finish digesting their food, their excrement is rich in important nutrients that help these krill and plankton flourish, aiding in increased photosynthesis and carbon storage from the atmosphere." A 2019 report published by the International Monetary Fund estimated that a great whale sequesters 33 tons of carbon dioxide each year on average, while a tree absorbs only up to 48 pounds a year -- a figure the report's authors used to suggest that conservationists could be better off saving whales than planting trees. The new paper explores how a recovery in whale populations to prewhaling levels -- between 4 million and 5 million, from slightly more than 1.3 million in 2019, according to the IMF report -- could increase the animals' ability to act as a carbon sink. (Commercial hunting, the main reason whales' numbers have dwindled, has decreased their populations by 81%, the researchers said.) Among a number of whale species, the amount of carbon that was being sequestered "jumps up by one or two orders of magnitude" with a recovery in the whale population, said Stephen Wing, a co-author of the paper and a marine science professor at the University of Otago in New Zealand. The numbers are "relatively small" considering the scope of the global climate challenge, "but relative to the promises that some nations make on reducing CO2 emissions, they're relatively large," he added. Whales, along with a number of ocean animals, are vulnerable to climate change as rising temperatures drive them into new habitats. They rank among the world's most endangered marine mammals, including the North Atlantic right whale, only about 340 of which remain. Whales are still being killed in startlingly high numbers, years after commercial whaling was banned, in waters brimming with ships that strike them and ropes that entangle them. Offshore wind turbines, part of President Biden's clean energy agenda, are also poised to encroach on their habitat as the administration tries to balance tackling global warming with protecting wildlife. "Whale recovery has the potential for long-term self-sustained enhancement of the ocean carbon sink," the authors wrote. "The full carbon dioxide reduction role of great whales (and other organisms) will only be realized through robust conservation and management interventions that directly promote population increases." The authors were cautious on the math behind including whale carbon in any wider climate-change mitigation strategies just yet, however, as there are still many scientific unknowns. They argued that recent studies valuing the carbon contribution of a single blue whale at $1.4 million "are based on assumptions beyond our understanding of whale ecology and biological oceanography." Information for this report was contributed by Dino Grandoni and Tatiana Schlossberg of The Washington Post.  Print Headline: Saving whales may save the planet, scientists say

         FORT SMITH -- The Sebastian County judge said he's looking forward to spending more time with his family and not having the responsibilities of a job after nearly five decades in county government. County Judge David Hudson will retire after his term expires Dec. 31. He started working for Sebastian County in 1976 and was first elected county judge in 1998. Hudson, 70, has been mentally preparing to leave behind the life his 46 years of service has entailed. This life has meant working with a variety of county officials and Quorum Courts, as well as for four previous county judges before getting the job himself. "For me, the job is not just an 8-5 job," said Hudson, a Republican. "You're thinking about the projects and the priorities and what you need to do after hours, thinking about what you're going to do that next week, and just understanding I'm going to be shifting the way that I function in trying to prepare myself for that." Steve Hotz, county treasurer and collector, will succeed Hudson as county judge effective Jan. 1. Hudson did not run for reelection this year. Local elected officials and community members came together to celebrate Hudson and his career at a reception at the Ben Geren Park safe shelter in Fort Smith on Dec. 8. Sheriff Hobe Runion described working with Hudson as both gratifying and educational. He said he doesn't know if anyone else in the state knows county government like Hudson does. "There might be, but I'm not aware of them," Runion said. "He's been very helpful with me, and I think that working with him, we were able to get a lot done and I considered him a friend." George McGill, mayor of Fort Smith, said he and Hudson worked frequently together, with Hudson always being fair. McGill discovered what Hudson is "made of" when Fort Smith was about to get hit by the 2019 Arkansas River flood. "We didn't have much time to think about what to do, but I saw him swing into action and practice leadership at its very best to the extent that our city and our people suffered very, very little pain, how he managed to work with all of us," McGill said. EDUCATION, ACCOMPLISHMENTS Hudson was born in Clarksville in 1952 and said he grew up in Fort Smith starting at about 3½ years old. He went to Northside High School before earning a bachelor's degree in business from the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, in 1976. He also earned a master's degree in public administration at the university in 1981. Hudson's career with Sebastian County started as an administrative assistant under County Judge Glenn Thames in 1976. He had previously interned at the Western Arkansas Planning and Development District. His new job presented Hudson an opportunity to serve in local government. One project he worked on was helping Thames administer a new system in which there would be only one county Quorum Court and budget. It took effect in January 1977. "In 1976, Sebastian County, since we have two county seats, Fort Smith and Greenwood, we actually had two quorum courts and two county budgets," Hudson said. "There was only one set of county elected officials." Hudson's first stint as county judge came when the Quorum Court appointed him to serve the remainder of County Judge Bob Boyer's term in 1982. He said this was an exciting chance for him to essentially lead the county. "That allowed me to set priorities and work with the court and the other elected officials to implement some changes," Hudson said. "One of the first things was to develop an approach to obtaining an in-house computer system." Hudson continued as administrative assistant after his appointment ended in 1983. He carried on in that role under county judges Bud Harper and Frank Glidewell before being elected to the county judge's seat in 1998. He would go on to win a total of 10 two-year terms as county judge, along with one four-year term that began in 2018. Hudson believes "conservative financial management while improving services" has been the theme of his career. He said this has involved being responsible with county money and multi-year planning for improvements while setting aside money in capital accounts, which allowed large projects to be implemented without county tax increases. Some of these projects include: Renovation of the county courthouse in Fort Smith for about $2 million in 1999. Expansion of the county jail in Fort Smith for about $4 million in 2007. Construction of a new courts building in Fort Smith for about $14.8 million between the county and city in 2008. Construction of the $10.9 million Parrot Island Waterpark with Fort Smith in 2015. Construction of a new county Emergency Medical Services facility in Greenwood for about $3 million in 2018. Hudson also established a county road asphalt overlay program and bridge replacement system, implemented improvements at county parks and oversaw criminal justice system initiatives. Despite this, Hudson said he will leave office with projects incomplete: the pending consolidation of the county's 911 dispatch centers, construction of a more than $5 million library in Greenwood and two towers meant to improve the county's emergency communication radio system. The jail also has ongoing crowding issues that need to be addressed. WHAT'S NEXT Hudson, however, said he's confident Hotz will do an excellent job as county judge. "I worked with Steve for a number of years and he's got a master's degree, he's well-educated," Hudson said. "I think he's basically pretty conservative in his approach to financial management. He certainly knows the human resource area well, and that's a very good asset. He's well-versed in county finances." Hotz, 66, said he started working as the county's human resources director in 2011. The Quorum Court appointed him county treasurer/collector in late 2019. Hotz beat fellow Republicans Denny Altes and Jeff Turner for the county judge seat in the May primary election. No Democrats filed for the position. Hotz said he always worked with Hudson in a way that would produce the best results for the county. He recalled Hudson working in a collaborative manner in that he tried to bring in the people who could contribute or had information to help them "end up with the right decision" on county matters. Hotz remarked he has big shoes to fill in succeeding Hudson, given the knowledge Hudson has accumulated over his career. But Hudson has helped Hotz prepare for his new role by bringing him into meetings concerning ongoing issues to get him up to speed and filling him in on things such as important contact information and the locations of files. "I feel like I know the people, I know the finances, I know the elected officials," Hotz said. "So I feel somewhat comfortable that I'm ready to go to work and continue the progress the county has made."  County Sales Tax Sebastian County residents voted to implement a 1% county sales tax in 1994. The tax was renewed with voter approval twice since then and is due to sunset in 2024. The question of renewal will have to go before voters again in 2023.

         Jose Chavez walked into Feed Rogers Food Pantry last month and asked for a sandwich. The volunteers at the pantry answered no. They couldn't give him a sandwich. Instead, they handed him a grocery tote and let him fill it with the fixings to make a sandwich -- and to make more sandwiches for his family of four. They helped him add fruit, salad, milk, juice and more to his bag. Feed Rogers is one of many programs of the Northwest Arkansas Food Bank. The regional food bank is the sole beneficiary this year of the Community Christmas Card project of the Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. In a decades-old holiday tradition, readers submit monetary donations to the newspaper, which gifts every penny to the food bank. And donations are tax-deductible. Readers who contribute $3 or more by Tuesday will see their names -- or the name of someone they want to honor -- listed on the Community Christmas Card published in the newspaper on Christmas Day. Last year, readers contributed $21,000 for the 2021 Christmas Card, which also went to the food bank. The Northwest Arkansas Food Bank provided 11.6 million meals in 2021 across Benton, Carroll, Madison and Washington counties through partnering agencies with direct access to clients in need, mobile pantries, emergency boxes and the state's Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Kent Eikenberry, food bank president and chief executive officer, said all money received from this year's Community Christmas Card will be added to the food bank's capital campaign. The board of the food bank in 2021 launched a $25 million capital campaign to build an 82,425-square-foot distribution center in Lowell and increase meals distributed by more than 60% by 2025 and 20 million meals by 2045. Eikenberry said $21 million of the money raised will go to the new facility, with $4 million reserved for programming to help the food insecure in Northwest Arkansas. Feed Rogers was part of the food bank's capital campaign from the start, Eikenberry said. But the opportunity arose to buy the building at 216 S. 13th St. and the food bank's board advanced the opening of the pantry. The new facility will include areas for cold storage and meat processing. It also will allow the food bank to increase the amount of fresh food distributed. The board has raised about 90% of the money sought in the campaign, Eikenberry said. The Northwest Arkansas Regional Planning Commission anticipates 1 million people living in Northwest Arkansas by 2045. An estimated 145,000 of those residents, about 14.5%, will live with food insecurity, Eikenberry said, citing information from the commission. The U.S. Department of Agriculture defines food insecurity as "a lack of consistent access to enough food for an active, healthy life." "You and I both know someone living with food insecurity right now," Eikenberry said. Checking the list Feed Rogers is the first direct service pantry for the food bank, which usually distributes food through partner agencies and mobile pantries, Eikenberry explained. The unique food pantry lets clients choose their own food in a grocery-store setting. "The old-school pantry model, where you hand them a box of food, just wasn't working," said Sabrina Thiede, the food bank's director of programs. "We need to get the right food to the right people." Feed Rogers opened March 30, in partnership with St. Vincent de Paul Catholic Church. Chelsea Tatlow, manager of Feed Rogers, said the pantry, since its opening to Friday, fed 2,419 households with 12,531 visits to the pantry. Guests schedule appointments -- either online, on the phone or in person -- to shop at the special store, Thiede said. No questions are asked beyond a guest's name and address. Each guest is given a grocery list upon arrival. Tatlow explained the shopping lists have been developed by the food bank team, listing what each shopper can get based on the size of the family. For example, one card listed what a shopper could pick up for a family of six: four complete meal mixes; four containers of soup; four protein choices, which would total 5 pounds of meat; four vegetable choices; four beverages; four pasta or rice products; four breakfast items; and four "flex" items, which could include dessert or bread if available. Each freezer or shelf is color coded to match the food groups listed on the shopping lists -- the vegetable area had a green sign and green color on the card. Some foods are not listed on the cards because they will perish in a day, Tatlow said, so clients may have as many as they want. The store recently received 22,000 pounds of sweet potatoes, which had no limit for guests. Neither did acorn squash. Each family also received one bag of apples and two bags of beans. "Then they spread their wings and fly," Thiede said. "They have the same shopping experience as you or me." The Feed Rogers facility resembles a grocery store, but without cash registers or self-checkout stations. Guests push shopping carts past shelves and freezers, making food choices. When their carts are full, volunteers "check out" the guests, ensuring they have gotten everything on their lists, and then bag the groceries. Staff and volunteers can help guests fill their carts with items for special dietary needs, like diabetes or gluten-free products when available, Tatlow said. And staff also can refer guests to other agencies for rental assistance, medical care and more. "We try to take care of the whole person with referrals, classes for overall health and well-being," she said. Guests can return in two weeks, unless they are facing an emergency situation, Tatlow said. Staff and volunteers also can provide insight into food that might be good for diabetics and provide recipes for preparing it. Volunteer Judy Bankhead of Rogers told shoppers they could store sweet potatoes in a paper bag in the same room as their hot water heaters, and the sweet potatoes would last all year. Bankhead said she volunteers five days a week -- two at Feed Rogers -- for the social interaction. She also is a client. She explains she gets fresh vegetables and fruits for herself. "But I got a gazillion sweet potatoes and gave them to my neighbors," Bankhead said. Loretta and D.J. Phillips, a mother and daughter, both had shopping baskets to feed their two families of two. The women both live on disability payments and visit Feed Rogers every few weeks or once a month. "It helps so much," Loretta Phillips said. "The price of food is outrageous," said D.J. Phillips. "We come here so we can pay our utilities." "And we don't pick out what we don't need," Loretta Phillips added. "We know that anyone can experience food insecurity and welcome all to our center," Tatlow said. "It is our top priority to create an environment where neighbors feel safe, and that they are treated with dignity and respect by staff and volunteers."

         SPRINGDALE -- Ken Hall could not believe what he was reading in early 2018. He asked a colleague to double-check. A just-passed change in federal tax law aimed to help people in lower-income areas by encouraging investments where they lived and worked. The areas described fit virtually all of Springdale east of Thompson Street in an otherwise thriving Northwest Arkansas. The new "opportunity zone" designation was no loophole for an already-thriving region to exploit, though, said Hall, a tax attorney at the time. The economic boom of recent years left much of Springdale behind including its downtown, he said in an interview. Renovating older buildings or clearing them to build anew cost more than starting fresh on then-undeveloped land in other parts of Northwest Arkansas. Efforts to revitalize downtown Springdale raised concern before 2018, said Lance Eads, formerly both a state senator for Springdale and Springdale Chamber of Commerce executive. Interstate 49 in Arkansas opened in 1999, a major traffic corridor that drew development westward. This accelerated the trend away from east Springdale, Eads said in an interview Wednesday. Downtown revitalization was a less-attractive option to some, he said. Opportunity zones changed the dynamic, attracting new investment downtown without competing with development in the west, he said. Today, Emma Opportunity, the investment fund led by Hall, leads a $3 million renovation of the First Security Bank building at 100 W. Emma Ave. in Springdale, one of the biggest of several projects downtown and in east Springdale by Hall's fund and others. Those projects include the "Little Emma" apartment building downtown, a 26-unit complex designed to be affordable compared to other rental properties in Northwest Arkansas. One of the advantages of the zones, Hall and others said, is how it makes projects profitable with lower rents and increases the supply of housing and commercial space in the tight Northwest Arkansas rental market, further easing price pressure. Investors large and small fund those projects by taking advantage of opportunity zones, he said. Virtually all of eastern Springdale lies in one of the four "opportunity zones" there, all of them bordering each other but divided into four zones since the changed tax law is based on census tracts. The U.S. Census Bureau defines tracts as "small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county or statistically equivalent entity that can be updated." The boundaries of each tract are drawn by the Census Bureau. "We thought we had five," said Bill Rogers, president of the Springdale Chamber of Commerce, about Springdale census tracts fitting the opportunity zone definition. Other opportunity zones in Northwest Arkansas include two in Fayetteville and one in both Rogers and Siloam Springs. Little Rock, the state's largest city, is the only other Arkansas city with four such zones within it, state records show. Those investment opportunities are not just for the rich and famous, Springdale Mayor Doug Sprouse said in a telephone interview Wednesday. "One of the best things about it is how local people have a means to pool their money together and invest," Sprouse said. "Yes, there are big names we'd all recognize investing, but so are others you wouldn't recognize, and some from outside the city." "I'm hard-pressed to find anything negative about it to the city," Sprouse said of opportunity zones. Rogers agreed. "Government incentives don't always work as they are supposed to, but this time in Springdale this is working exactly as it is supposed to," he said. Opportunity zone defined Investors pay less in capital gains taxes when they profit off projects within an opportunity zone. Savvy investors hang on to investments such as stocks for as long as they can as long as those investments rise in value, Hall said. Any profit they make from selling them is taxed by a combined total of 25% of state and federal capital gains taxes. Bipartisan members of Congress, led by Sens. Tim Scott, R-S.C., and Cory Booker, D-N.J., wanted a change to encourage investors to put money into relatively low-income areas, according to news accounts. They settled on census tracts, which can vary in size and population, rather than cities, counties or other political boundaries in determining where those relatively low-income districts were. They wanted to draw investment to tracts with an individual poverty rate of 20% or more and an overall median income of 80% or less of the surrounding area. The most important provision of the tax change, Hall said, is any increase in the value of investments in opportunity zones is not subject to capital gains taxes so long as the investors do not sell the property for at least 10 years. "You can't build junk and flip it," said Don Harris of Springdale, a partner with Hall and Tom Lundstrum of Cave Springs in the Emma Opportunity fund. A renovation or new building needs quality workmanship and materials for the investment to keep its value and profit in 10 years, he said. Harris is a former executive for Walmart Stores Inc. The big advantage Springdale has with opportunity zones, he and Hall said, was Springdale residents with money to invest plus an overall thriving region attracting investment. "I'm from Flippin. It is also in an opportunity zone, but it has not attracted opportunity zone investments," Hall said, referring to the Marion County town. But Flippin in north-central Arkansas lacks both Northwest Arkansas' growth and a local investor base as large as Springdale's, he said. The growth in Northwest Arkansas can now be brought back downtown and to other areas of eastern Springdale, including much of the area's older industrial base. Investor support Harris agreed the local pool of willing investors proved vital. "We found a lot of people who want to invest here and help their town," he said. Each state's governor decided which qualifying census tracts were "opportunity zones." Rogers credited his predecessor, Perry Webb, with Springdale's success in getting the four tracts in the east on Gov. Asa Hutchinson's list. "Somebody called our office on a Friday after the law passed and asked if he'd heard of these opportunity zones," Rogers said. "Perry said, 'No I haven't, but I'll call you back on Monday.'" Within a couple of working days, the chamber rallied behind getting designations for Springdale. As a senator at the time, Eads helped coordinate the presentation to the governor's staff, according to Rogers. "The governor wanted areas that could show results quickly," Eads said. "We were able to make the case." The onset of the covid pandemic in 2020 delayed some of the opportunity zones' full impact, but now the tax change is taking full effect, according to Rogers, Eads and Sprouse. "Much of our development in downtown Springdale is because of it," Rogers said.

         FAYETTEVILLE -- The library has been relying on reserve money to balance its budget since opening the expansion last year because the property tax hike voters approved for operations isn't enough, its executive director said. The model is unsustainable, said Executive Director David Johnson. If financials stay as they are for too long, the library will have to consider its options, which may include cutting services or personnel or presenting a new property tax referendum to voters, he said. An expanded Fayetteville Public Library opened in January 2021, made possible by a 2.7-mill property tax increase voters approved in 2016. The library's total property tax levy is 3.7 mills. Of the 2.7-mill increase, 1.2 mills will sunset within 30 years after paying about $26.9 million of the nearly $50 million cost of the expansion's construction. The library's nonprofit foundation has been raising money to cover the remaining $23 million. The other 1.5 mills will stay to help cover operating costs. Of the 1.5 mills, 0.9 goes toward new costs for the expansion's operation. The remaining 0.6 mills has gone toward operations for the original portion of the library that opened in 2004. "I would say we underestimated," Johnson said. "We asked for as much as we possibly could get that we felt like the voters would approve, and it wasn't enough." The library's expansion includes several features beyond what libraries traditionally offer. Those features include the center for innovation with several simulators and creative studios that can provide job training, the 700-seat event center, a yoga and dance studio, a teaching kitchen next to the deli and an outdoor courtyard. The plan after voters approved the 2016 proposal was to pay off the amount for construction as quickly as possible and hope revenue generators at the expansion -- such as the deli and event center -- along with donations would supplement the operational money, Johnson said. "Those were things we were holding out for, thinking they were going to come online with a little bit more vigor than they have," he said. Along with revenue not being as high as anticipated, expenses also have exceeded projections, Johnson said. The pandemic impacted operations, as it did across the globe, and increased utility costs have added to the library's financial challenges, he said. Breaking down the numbers The library's board on Monday approved a $12.9 million budget for next year. Most of the library's revenue comes from property taxes, with $5.2 million projected next year. Nearly $3.3 million will come from the city next year, with additional revenue generated from charges for services and from state and federal grants. The library plans to use $442,500 in reserve money next year to balance its budget. So far this year, it has spent a little more than $478,000 in reserve money, according to financial information provided by Tamika Ball, the library's director of finance and accounting. It spent about $108,000 in reserve money last year, when the expansion opened in January. The library now has close to $1.4 million available in reserve money, Ball said. It projects to have a little more than $1 million available next year after using the allocated reserve money, she said. The library has unspent money in each of its funds each year for categories such as information technology, facilities or the expansion's operation; it puts the money back into the budget to use as reserve for the next year, Johnson said. The reserve money is meant to address unforeseen needs that may arise, he said. For now, when the library has an unforeseen need, it often turns to the city for help. For example, the city allocated $750,000 next year for the library to replace the air-conditioning system in the original portion of the building built in 2004. The library is not part of the city government, but the city provides assistance with capital needs. The library has its own millage that's separate from what the city gains in property tax. Johnson said he knows the city's goodwill and relying on reserve money will only get the library so far. "It's not been a straight line the way you dreamed that it would be," he said. "We understood this was probably going to be an up and down path to making this work, and it's been that." The library's board is aware of how reliant the operation has been on reserve money, said Bret Park, board chairman. A global pandemic happened in the middle of taking on a huge expansion project, and the library has no other choice but to continue operation to serve the public, he said. "The notion that we would have reserves and rely on reserves when we need to isn't a novel concept," Park said. "My feeling is it's important to continue to operate and to continue to fundraise and to continue the capital campaign to get ourselves back into a positive place where we could start replenishing reserves." The library doesn't function on a corporate cash-flow basis, Park said. It relies on public dollars and donations to operate. Park said he took pride in the fact that library administrators were able to substantially complete construction in the face of unforeseen circumstances associated with the pandemic and inflation. Any potential financial solutions, including a new property tax referendum, would have to be brought up by staff at future board meetings and discussed, Park said. "Then it's part of the healthy discourse of the way that we consider things," he said. Funding often doesn't match the value of a library's role in a community, said Maria McCauley, president of the Public Library Association. Finding one-time sources of money, such as for construction of a new facility, is generally easier than pinning down ongoing sources of money, she said. The key is planning, McCauley said. Libraries have to stay flexible with their plans with inflation increasing the cost of doing business across the country, she said. That can mean operating a library with minimal staff, McCauley said. A study from the Public Library Association estimates about 27% of public libraries in the country lost staff positions last year either because of budget cuts or staff leaving. The association estimates there are about 9,200 public libraries across the country. The community gets a return when it invests in its public library, McCauley said. "The value of the library programs and services to advance our educational and economic opportunities all comes back," she said. "We see that study after study has found that the value that public libraries provide doubles the value for every dollar invested." Planning ahead Johnson said it's time for him and other Fayetteville library officials to start thinking about how to make the operation solvent. That means either reducing costs or increasing revenue, he said. "Those conversations are very real, and they need to start immediately," Johnson said. "It's a slow ramp and buildup to whatever these solutions are." The library has had more than 424,000 visits so far this year with more than 90,000 cardholders. The programming the library offers is free, such as cooking lessons in its teaching kitchen, simulation lab training courses at its innovation center, and dance and yoga classes in its art and movement room, among others. Restructuring construction bonds for the expansion and asking voters for a new property tax referendum is a possibility, though administrators and board members have had no serious conversations about that yet, Johnson said. The idea potentially would be to keep a taxpayer's yearly payment the same, but put less annual revenue toward payment of construction bonds and more toward yearly operation, he said. The construction bonds would take longer to pay off in that scenario. The bonds are scheduled to be paid off within 30 years under the current proposal voters approved in 2016. Presenting a new property tax referendum to voters would present a challenge, Johnson said. Communicating to the public that a new vote would result in the same yearly property tax payments would be difficult, he said. Washington County voters rejected a sales tax increase in November to pay for a jail expansion, and public sentiment against any kind of initiative dealing with taxes could carry over into a library election, Johnson said. Until the library's operational revenue can adequately pay for its demand, it will continue to rely on reserve money, philanthropic dollars and help from the city, Johnson said. Reserve money is limited. Many other worthy nonprofits compete for philanthropic dollars in the region. Help from the city depends on the political will of the City Council to do so, he said. "We certainly don't want to be in a position where we're having to make cuts," Johnson said. "I think the community is wildly embracing the things that we're doing and is fully supportive and understands the value that we bring to the community. So to start cutting things almost seems punitive."  By the numbers The following lists the amount of reserve money the Fayetteville Public Library has spent to balance its budget in the last few years: 2020 — $367,978 2021* — $108,144 2022 — $478,037 (year to date) 2023 — $442,500 (projected) * The librarys expansion opened in January 2021.

        100 YEARS AGO Dec. 18, 1922 HUNTSVILLE — Notice has been given that a bill will be introduced in the legislature at the 1923 session providing for the creation of an improvement district to construct an improved public highway from Huntsville to Ozark, the proposed route beginning at Huntsville and running west via Manty to Drakes creek, thence by Combs to Cass and Ozark. 50 YEARS AGO Dec. 18, 1972 JONESBORO — Mayor Ray Goodson of Black Rock (Craighead County) said plans were under way to obtain a sanitary sewer system for the town. Goodson said that a system will cost about $120,000 and would require a year to complete. Installation of a system was approved at a recent public meeting. 25 YEARS AGO Dec. 18, 1997 A neighborhood association and several downtown residents have filed suit against Little Rock and a local mental health organization to block apartments for mentally ill adults now being built near two historic neighborhoods. The 12-unit Kathleen Peek Apartments are under construction at 1515 Rock St. between 15th and 16th streets on land owned by the Little Rock Community Mental Health Center, a nonprofit organization. … Proposed tenants are adults diagnosed with major depression, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, but no convicted felons will be accepted, Tom Grunden, the organizations executive director, told residents at an October meeting held to address neighborhood concerns. … The suit asks for a preliminary injunction to halt construction, which began Oct. 16, and a court order permanently forbidding the agency from putting the apartments on that site. … Residents also contend that the design of the apartment building does not conform with historic district guidelines for the area. 10 YEARS AGO Dec. 18, 2012 The Arkansas Supreme Court Committee on Professional Conduct has agreed to seek a change in its procedures to allow citizens to publicly disclose any formal complaints they file with the committee. The agreement stems from a federal lawsuit filed last year by Little Rock-based journalist and author Mara Leveritt, who challenged the current procedures as unconstitutional. Current procedures deem all formal complaints of alleged attorney misconduct to be “absolutely privileged and confidential and exempt from disclosure under the Arkansas Freedom of Information Act,” with violators subject to being held in contempt of court and punished by a fine or jail time. … “I see this agreement as a step forward for Arkansas,” Leveritt said in an e-mail. “In the past, citizens such as myself were threatened with a fine or jail if they discussed a complaint filed with the Supreme Courts Committee on Professional Conduct. Reporters were similarly restrained. The committee has now agreed to respect citizens First Amendment right to free speech.”

        Ashley Roland, 28, and Nathan Bridges, 33, have been arrested and charged with capital murder after the body of Roland's 6-year-old son was found buried below a hallway floor inside a Lee County home Friday night, police said. Agents are also investigating alleged scalp burns sustained by Roland's 6-year-old daughter, according to a news release from Arkansas State Police.  Roland and Bridges, who are being held at the Lee County jail, are also charged with abuse of a corpse, tampering with physical evidence and endangering the welfare of a minor, the release states. Special agents of the Arkansas State Police Criminal Investigation Division were called to the home in the Moro community west of Marianna by Lee County sheriffs deputies around 10:45 p.m Friday, authorities said. Based on their initial investigation, agents believe the boy died from injuries sustained in the home, possibly three months ago, the release states. The state medical examiner will determine the manner and cause of death. Police said Roland's daughter was taken to a Memphis hospital where she is in stable condition. CORRECTION: Ashley Roland, 28, was arrested and charged with capital murder. An earlier version of this story misspelled Roland's name, citing incorrect information provided by Arkansas State police.

        BENTONVILLE — A Benton County sheriffs deputy died Saturday morning during a motorcycle escort crash, according to a news release from the Sheriffs Office. Detective Paul Daniel Newell, 51, of Gravette was escorting the Wreaths Across America procession through Bentonville, the release states. Wreaths Across America provides wreaths to veterans cemeteries nationwide. The accident occurred at about 6:30 a.m. Saturday, at the intersection of Southeast Walton Boulevard and Southeast Metro Parkway, just west of the Interstate 49 interchange, according to a report from the Arkansas Department of Public Safety. Newell, on his motorcycle, was eastbound in the center turn lane of Walton Boulevard. A 2022 Freightliner truck was also eastbound, the report states. Newell hit the curb, lost control and struck the Freightliner, according to the report. Newell started his law enforcement career in the detention division with the Sheriffs Office on Dec. 1, 1998, and went on to graduate from the Arkansas Law Enforcement Training Academy, according to the release. He served as a patrol deputy, patrol sergeant, training sergeant, lieutenant in the administration section and most recently a detective assigned to the Criminal Investigation Division. He was a certified instructor in numerous courses and placed a high emphasis on sharing his training and experience, the release states.    Print Headline: Sheriffs deputy dies in accident

        An investigative file on the death of Jonesboro officer Vincent Parks, 38, revealed "concerning issues with the culture" of the state's training facility, including hazing, a letter written by Pulaski County Prosecutor Larry Jegley says. While not finding any criminal charges, Jegley's letter, which was released Friday, cites the state medical examiner's autopsy report that ruled the cause of death an accident caused by sickle cell disease triggered by physical exertion and heat stress, hypertensive heart disease and obesity. It states no one was identified as having precipitated the accidental death. "However, the file did contain concerning issues with the culture of the training program at ALETA [Arkansas Law Enforcement Training Academy]," Jegley wrote to Arkansas State Police Col. Bill Bryant. "Including Hazing and the lack of helpful cooperation in the investigation. We will not reiterate those concerns here, but would invite a careful inquiry into the practice, procedures, and other problems at ALETA made obvious in the ASP report." Jegley did not return a phone call or text from a reporter seeking more information after the release of the letter. Jacquelyn Parks, Vincent Parks' mother, said Friday that she was disappointed in the decision. "I think someone should be held accountable for me losing my only son," Parks said. "It is very hurtful." Parks also is survived by a wife and daughter. The investigative file also wasn't immediately available as the Arkansas State Police works to redact it under the Arkansas Freedom of Information Act. Bill Sadler, Arkansas State Police spokesman, said it could be available by early next week.  The medical finding and Jegley's letter contrast the official statements released July 17, the day of Parks' death, at the direction of then-Public Safety Director Jami Cook, which claimed Parks had not participated in any physical activity before showing signs of medical distress. The review of Parks' death was changed to a criminal investigation in August after investigators learned of facts "contrary" to the original statements. The decision also came after the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette attempted to question Cook about text messages she sent to Alison Williams, Gov. Asa Hutchinson's chief of staff, and three other law enforcement officials soon after Parks fell ill. The texts, obtained through a newspaper's Freedom of Information Act request, stated Parks "fell out" after jogging to and from his car and engaging in four minutes of calisthenics. Hours later Cook authorized the release of the statement that said Parks did not participate in any physical activity. The release was sent through the Arkansas Commission on Law Enforcement Standards, which oversees officer training in the state. Cook also was director of the commission at the time. State Reps. Frances Cavenaugh, R-Walnut Ridge, and Mark Berry, R-Ozark, along with Jonesboro Police Chief Rick Elliot all publicly questioned the information released in the official statement. Yet, weeks after Parks' death, state officials maintained the original statement was accurate. "I appreciate the fact that the prosecutor took the case on," Elliott said Friday. "This was their general conclusion as far as criminal charges. I understand. The family certainly has the right to pursue any civil means they desire." Elliott said he hopes ALETA staff look into Jegley's allegations and address any concerns that are found. "I know from my own officers that were there, some sprinting and other stuff was happening," Elliott said. "We knew that in the beginning." Four other Jonesboro officers started training with Parks at the academy. "Things happen and if it is a medical incident, so be it, but if you are trying to be anything less than honest about what took place -- that throws a shadow of doubt of what else was going on," Elliott said. "That's the part that bothers me." Cook announced her resignation July 22 citing health issues she'd battled since December 2019. While her resignation letter is dated a day after Parks died, officials have said her resignation was in the works prior to Parks' death. Sadler issued the first news release on Parks death. In August, he sent an email to the Democrat-Gazette outlining the events that led to the news release. He said Cook first contacted him about Parks' death at 3:24 July 17. She gave an overview of Parks' death, in which she said Parks was extracted from class formation and taken to a shaded area where oxygen was administered prior to participating in physical training. Training Academy Supervisor Joe Dubois also recapped the events and reiterated that Parks had not participated in physical training, Sadler said in the email. Both Cook and Dubois reviewed the release before it was sent, Sadler said. "When you say you weren't doing something, that you actually were but now find out during an investigation it wasn't exactly truthful, that is bothersome," Elliott said Friday. Elliott said he's spoken with some of ALETA's command since the incident. "I'm quite confident all these issues will certainly be addressed, if they haven't already," Elliott said. "They want things done right." Less than a month after Parks' death, J.R. Hankins was named the director of the Commission on Law Enforcement Standards by Hutchinson. In late August, Hankins said there was "some activity" prior to Parks' death when questioned by the newspaper -- the first time a state official talked publicly about the case. At the time, he said he was unsure of the "extent." Parks died after reporting to the academy, held at Camp Robinson in North Little Rock, on his first day of training. He'd already been sworn in as an officer of the Jonesboro Police Department, after passing screening and some training there. Central Arkansas was under a heat advisory from 1 p.m. to 8 p.m. that Sunday, according to Dylan Cooper, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service in North Little Rock. Heat advisories are put in place when heat indexes could reach 105 or greater for a region. Cooper said previously that the closest sensor to Camp Robinson is located at Bill and Hillary Clinton National Airport/Adams Field. He said that sensor recorded temperatures at 97 degrees with a heat index of about 106 at 1 p.m. July 17. He said the temperature was 99 degrees at 2 p.m. with a heat index of 106. The commission originally reported Parks showed up at the academy shortly after 1 p.m. The original release said he exhibited symptoms of medical distress before an "initial exercise regimen." The commission's release also said instructors separated Parks from the class prior to the regimen that started at 1:30 p.m. Berry questioned the commission about a heat policy days after Parks' death. "There is absolutely no excuse for a heat-related casualty in a training environment, especially when the Department of Health has excessive heat warnings all over the state for several weeks," Berry said at that time. Berry previously was director of the Arkansas Military Department, adjutant general and the first commanding general of the Arkansas National Guard, according to his legislative website. Cody Hiland, former chief legal counsel for the Arkansas Department of Public Safety, questioned Berry, at the time, on how he knew it was a heat-related death since Parks' body was still undergoing testing and an autopsy at the state Crime Laboratory. "The health of the people who go through these training exercises are of the utmost concern to the Department of Public Safety and [Arkansas Law Enforcement Training Academy]," Hiland said. "I can't speak to exactly what happened because I don't know. I don't have that information, but at the end of the day accidents happen. If accidents can be prevented, then we need to do everything we can to prevent them, but I'm uncomfortable answering questions about facts that I have no knowledge of." Hiland resigned from the position in September with the announcement he had been hired by Gov.-elect Sarah Huckabee Sanders' campaign team. Cook had been asked to attend the hearing but was unable to because a graduation she was attending in Northwest Arkansas on the same day. A legislative hearing regarding Parks' death has been rescheduled multiple times as the investigation remained ongoing. Hankins said Friday that he had yet to review the entirety of the investigative file and was unable to respond to Jegley's comments. TRAINING CHANGES Elliott also would like to see policy changes or legislation that addresses training in extreme weather conditions. Hankins said in August that the commission is reviewing training in extreme heat. At the time no policy had been created. The commission had recently purchased WetBulb globes used by state athletic departments and the military to gauge heat conditions before training. Each branch of the U.S. military uses a flag system to determine the intensity of physical exercise allowed at each WetBulb temperature. The U.S. Marine Corps doesn't allow physical training and strenuous exercise at a black flag or WetBulb temperature of 90 and above, according to its website. The flag system also takes into account personnel's acclimation to extreme heat. At 88 to 89.9, all activity for any personnel with less than 12 weeks' training in hot weather should halt. Physical activity should be halted for anyone with less than three weeks of heat exposure at 85 to 87.9, the website says. Joey Walters, Arkansas Activities Association deputy executive director, said that the association started requiring the use of WetBulbs for athletic practices in 2018. The guidelines are based of the American College of Sports Medicine. According to the association's website, there are to be no outdoor workouts over a reading of 92. At 90 to 92 the length of participation can't extend an hour and there must be 30 minutes of rest breaks distributed throughout the hour. The maximum practice time goes up and rest period goes down as the temperature drops.

        An Arkansas working group on food deserts formed earlier this year held a news conference on Friday to release its report and recommendations. The Arkansas Governor's Food Desert Working Group was led by co-chairs Kathy Webb, chief executive officer of the Arkansas Hunger Relief Alliance, and Kenya Eddings, executive director of the Arkansas Minority Health Commission. "While efforts to combat food deserts started long before this year, there's been little success as we continue to see communities across the state lose access to grocery stores," Webb told attendees Friday at Little Rock's Union Station. The group's work came about when Webb and state Rep. Tippi McCullough, D-Little Rock, asked Gov. Asa Hutchinson to create a group to tackle the issue, and he agreed, Webb recalled. Eighteen individuals served on the working group. They worked with the Winthrop Rockefeller Institute to author the report, which relied on existing data sources, outreach to successful models in other rural states and focus groups conducted in person and online. Though definitions for the term "food desert" vary, for the purposes of their report, working group members arrived at the following definition: "A community is a food desert or low-food access location if residents must travel more than one mile in an urban setting or more than 10 miles in a rural setting to obtain a selection of fresh, nutritious food." They focused on how to establish sustainable grocery options in low-access areas and address hurdles that users of food benefit programs face. Citing economic data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the report said 62 of Arkansas' 75 counties have a low-income, low-access census tract or identified food desert. [DOCUMENT: Read food desert working group report » arkansasonline.com/1217deserts/]  The report also cited the prevalence of chronic health conditions such as high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease in Arkansas compared to other states. Residents without easy access to a vehicle or public transportation can face challenges getting to the grocery store. Additionally, profit margins for a traditional grocery store are often very low, "making them vulnerable to market changes," the report said. Recommendations for the governor and Arkansas General Assembly included naming a food access liaison within the governor's office and creating a legislative subcommittee on food access. Members endorsed fiscal support for food access through methods such as tax incentives for grocers who open stores in low-income, low-access areas or a revolving loan program. Working group members also recommended that state lawmakers improve access to state food benefit programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children. Those steps might include long-term implementation of covid-19-era flexibility when it comes to accessing SNAP and WIC, the report said. "Many Arkansans are unable to take part in SNAP or WIC due to the burdensome application and recertification processes," the report said. Potential SNAP recipients in Arkansas face an asset limit, which members recommended raising or removing. The asset limit "serves as a cliff and a disincentive for individuals to accumulate savings and become upwardly mobile," the report said. Municipal officials were encouraged to "develop community-driven, creative models to increase food access," according to the report, which presented several working models from other states. Mayor Zola Hudson of Altheimer told attendees Friday that the city's grocery store closed in 2019, creating an extra burden on low-income families, seniors and those without transportation. Residents of Altheimer number fewer than 700. As a result of the closure, many people had to use part of their grocery money to pay others to take them to Pine Bluff or Stuttgart to buy groceries, she said. Hudson said that because of the working group, officials near Altheimer are examining the GOODS (Grocery Online Ordering Distribution Service) model out of Drew, Miss., in which groceries ordered online are then delivered to a central location. The project "would mean the world to our community, and it truly means the world to us," Hudson said. "And I am so excited about being a part of the solution."

        The pastor of Arkansas' second-largest United Methodist congregation was suspended Friday, one day after overseeing a meeting to adopt new bylaws and new lay leadership for Jonesboro First United Methodist Church. Northeast District Superintendent John Fleming had previously urged the longtime minister, John Miles, not to hold the meeting, warning that the proposed action items were "clearly contrary to the Constitution of the United Methodist Church" and would not be "recognized by the State of Arkansas or the Arkansas Conference of the United Methodist Church." But the meeting, organized by church members wishing to break away from the denomination, went forward as planned, with those present voting 629 to 9 against remaining with the United Methodist Church. The bylaws and leaders provisions passed by similarly lop-sided margins. Leaders of Stay UMC Jonesboro, which opposes disaffiliation, were on hand to challenge the legality of the proceedings and observe, but did not cast ballots. A formal complaint, signed by Fleming and the church's other Arkansas district superintendents, quickly followed. In a letter to the Arkansas Annual Conference late Friday afternoon, Bishop Gary Mueller said he had suspended Miles "from all pastoral duties effective immediately." Utilizing a provision in the denomination's Book of Discipline, the Arkansas Conference has also declared "exigent circumstances," Mueller wrote. "Among other things, this action immediately vests title to all property of the First United Methodist Church Jonesboro in the Arkansas Conference Board of Trustees for the protection of the rights of the United Methodist Church and those United Methodists wishing to continue to worship in their church in Jonesboro," he wrote. According to Paragraph 2501 of the Book of Discipline, united Methodist congregations hold their property, in trust, "for the benefit of the entire denomination." Under Paragraph 2553, which was added in 2019, congregations were given a limited right to sever ties "over issues related to human sexuality." It's an escape route that more than 2,000 Methodist congregations have taken; it sunsets on Dec. 31, 2023. Citing "reasons of conscience around issues of human sexuality," Jonesboro First United Methodist Church voted 944 to 412 on July 31 to disaffiliate from the nation's second-largest Protestant denomination, eventually negotiating a disaffiliation agreement with the Arkansas Conference's board of trustees. The trustees determined, among other things, that Jonesboro had complied with the discernment process and had surpassed the two-thirds vote required to break away. They also reached a financial resolution, with the Jonesboro congregation agreeing to pay an additional year's tithes (roughly $280,000) and approximately $400,000 to cover its pro rata share of the Conference's defined pension obligations. Jonesboro members who remain loyal to the denomination challenged the fairness of the process and have continued to gather, meeting for worship at the Valley View School District's performing arts center. On Nov. 19, at a special session of the Arkansas Annual Conference in Hot Springs, clergy and lay members rejected the agreement, with 254 in favor and 335 opposed to ratifying it. Jonesboro was one of three congregations that had their disaffiliations vetoed that day; 35 others were approved. Since then, Mueller and others have urged both sides to use mediation in an attempt resolve their differences. Saying that he was writing "with a heavy heart," Mueller Friday described the events that preceded Miles' suspension. "The membership of First United Methodist Church Jonesboro was notified twice that a meeting for church members called by Rev. John Miles for December 15, 2022 was not authorized in accordance with our long-held church structure. Rev. Miles was instructed not to hold the unauthorized meeting, but proceeded to do so. The vote, which purported to adopt new 'bylaws', was in violation of The Book of Discipline and illegal according to Arkansas State law," he wrote. "I am deeply saddened that we find ourselves in the current situation. No one wins, and we all lose; most of all the Body of Christ and the mission to which Jesus calls us. I want to ask you to pray that hearts of peace will prevail and a positive way forward will be found. While it is a difficult and painful time for all involved, I remain resolute in the hope that is found in the birth of the Christ Child," he added. In a video posted on the congregation's Facebook page, Miles acknowledged his suspension from ministry but indicated he won't be going anywhere. "This is all part of a legal process and I just want you to know I'll be here Sunday. I plan to be here for the following Sundays," he said. "Right now, let's just trust the Lord, but also let's trust our lawyers. They're working through all this and they'll get this settled," he said. "Let's enjoy church. Let's enjoy Christmas. Let's enjoy one another and we'll get through this. Let's just remember to keep putting Jesus first in our lives." Bill Bristow, an attorney and member of Stay UMC Jonesboro who attended Thursday's meeting, said people booed and someone said "Trip him" as he made his way to the microphone. Miles' suspension was foreseeable, he suggested. "I'm not surprised and, surely, given the warnings that had been given by the district superintendent, the pastor's side would not have been surprised by these events," he said. "The [United Methodist] Church has spoken, and we will see if it becomes necessary for a court to speak," he said. He predicted the denomination and those loyal to it would weather the storm. "I can't tell you what the immediate future holds. But I think, down the road, we're going to have a very vibrant and growing and strong United Methodist Church in Jonesboro," he said.
