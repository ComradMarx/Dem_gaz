        The State House Education Committee reconvened Tuesday afternoon to hear testimony from the public on Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders education overhaul plan, with more than 90 people signed up to speak on the bill. Cassandra Bone spoke for the legislation, saying public schools generally arent equipped to serve students with special needs, including her son. Bone said her child was able to attend Compass Academy in Conway, a private, non-profit school for children with developmental disabilities, thanks to a scholarship. “My child who was barely speaking is doing multiplication,” Bone said. “Every child should have the opportunity if they dont fit the mold.” Heath Bennett, superintendent of Haskell Harmony Grove School, opposed the bill, questioning how state officials would find the funding to cover its provisions. Bennett said the bills voucher program would do little to help students in his district who take more than two-hour bus rides to school. “Its very disheartening to listen to how public schools fail all the time,” he said. “If you look at my ACT scores, you may wonder how Im a superintendent. I was very blessed to have people who believed in me a long time ago. Thats what public schools do.” — Will Langhorne 11:34 a.m.: State House committee opens discussion of Sanders' education bill Members of the Arkansas House of Representatives had their first chance to weigh in on Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders education overhaul plan Tuesday morning before a large crowd at the state Capitol. Rep. Keith Brooks, sponsor of Senate Bill 294, also known as the LEARNS Act, presented the bill to members of the House Education Committee, calling it “the most aggressive” education package in the states history. The introduction was made before a packed hearing room in the large multi-agency complex known as Big MAC, where some onlookers were asked to leave because the crowd was over capacity. The bill calls for a phased-in voucher program that will provide 90% of per student state foundation funding for students to attend a private or home school and a $14,000 increase the starting salary for teachers. Rep. Brian Evans, chair of the House Education Committee, said the committee wouldn't take action on the bill Tuesday, and would instead debate and vote on the bill during a special order of business Wednesday. If approved by the committee, the full House could vote on the bill as early as Thursday, Evans said. The Senate approved the bill last week, but if approved by the House the legislation would have to move back to the Senate for a concurring vote before heading to the governor for action. Prior to public testimony, members of the committee asked Brooks and Education Secretary Jacob Olivia about what effect the bill will have on funding, rural school districts. Lawmakers asked how school districts will pay for the proposed $50,000 minimum salary for teachers. The bill also calls for the repeal of the Teacher Fair Dismissal Act, the state law that requires educators be given written notice before being fired. Brooks said an amendment that he filed Friday would add back in some due protections for teachers to have a hearing before being fired. Brooks said the repeal of the law would allow school districts to fire poor performing teachers. Rep. Steven Walker, R-Horseshoe Bend, asked how the school will evaluate “non-testing” teachers such as physical education and music teachers. Olivia said each school district will come up with ways to evaluate “non-testing” school districts. Rep. Ron McNair, R-Harrison, asked what input the public will have in the rule-making authority it prescribes for the Department of Education, saying it seems that only after the bills will bureaucrats and lawmakers determine how the bill will work. Brooks said the public will be a part of the rule-making process. — Neal Earley Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        Severe storms and a high possibility of strong and long-tracked tornadoes are predicted for much of Arkansas Thursday, forecasters said. The lower two-thirds of Arkansas is at an enhanced risk of severe weather, according to a Tuesday briefing from the National Weather Service.  An enhanced risk is defined by the weather service as several severe storms that will produce very large hail, damaging winds and/or tornadoes, a tweet from the service said.  “A concerning amount of instability and wind energy will fuel more numerous severe storms on Thursday and Thursday night,” the briefing said.  “The storm system moving in Thursday night has a higher potential for severe weather than weve seen in some time,” said Travis Shelton, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in North Little Rock. Storms on Thursday are predicted to have hail as big as baseballs, 80 mph winds or stronger and a high potential for tornadoes, Shelton said on Tuesday.  He said the storms will likely last until early Friday morning, with some rain possibly lingering into Friday.  The northern third of the state is at a marginal or slight risk for severe weather, meaning storms could still produce hail but it will be smaller and tornadoes are less likely, the weather service said.  Wednesday is also forecast to have scattered severe storms and a marginal or slight chance of severe weather for most of the state, Shelton said.  The tornado potential for Wednesday is very low, the briefing said. Winds could be as strong 60 mph and hail could be as big as a quarter.  “In addition to severe weather, several inches of rain are likely Wednesday through Thursday night. With the ground saturated in many areas, flash flooding is expected,” the briefing said.  Meteorologists said that ongoing river flooding, especially in the White River Basin, will worsen and other basins could experience new river flooding.  Shelton said that Little Rock could see up to half an inch of rain on Wednesday and anywhere between two to three inches on Thursday.  “There could be even more than that if strong storms move over the same place,” Shelton said.  The forecaster said that Arkansas drivers should be careful when driving on roads covered by water.  “Sometimes drivers are confident and think they know what they road looks like, but once water is covering it you cant know the road is still there,” Shelton said.   Matt Ramsey, a spokesman for Entergy, said that the electrical company is always “storm ready” and is watching the weather and planning to react.  “The weather is a funny thing and hard to predict but with as much wind and possibly tornadoes are involved they could knock tree limbs into lines and power poles and there could be outages,” Ramsey said.  He said crews were not allowed in bucket trucks to fix lines if winds were stronger than 25 to 30 mph.  “Once it is safe, we will have crews out there to fix any damage,” Ramsey said.  Both Ramsey and Shelton said that theyd recommend Arkansans preparing by getting a first aid kit with medical supplies, nonperishable food, a charged cell phone and water.  “Make sure you have a shelter or a place to go thats secure in case severe weather is in your area” Shelton said, “And make sure you have a way to receive weather alerts, whether that is your cell phone, television or weather radio.”  Shelton said some changes could be made to the forecast closer to Thursday and he encourages people check for updates frequently.  Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         FORT SMITH -- University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences officials announced Tuesday an anonymous donor gave $600,000 to the school to continue providing contraception devices for uninsured post-partum patients in Fort Smith and Little Rock. Officials said in a news release the intrauterine devices and birth-control implants are inserted before a woman is discharged after giving birth to reduce unintended pregnancies and increase birth spacing. Insertions can cost more than $3,000 and aren't reimbursable by the state Medicaid program, according to the release. UAMS said the money is provided as part of the Increasing Equity and Access to Contraception in Arkansas Initiative. Last year, UAMS received $175,000 to supply the devices to 297 women at two birthing hospitals -- UAMS in Little Rock and Baptist Health in Fort Smith. This year, a UAMS team led by Dr. Nirvana Manning of the UAMS College of Medicine Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology intends to provide them to 449 patients in those facilities as well as the UAMS West Family Medicine Residency Program in Fort Smith. "This grant has been instrumental in not only providing access to contraceptive coverage that is in line with national recommendations but also in providing data that we hope will support the expansion to all patients, regardless of insurance coverage," Manning said. The money pays for the devices and the cost of insertion, as well as a focus on clinician training "to increase knowledge and create clinical champions within the hospital network," according to UAMS' application for the grant. The application said a study in South Carolina showed the use of the devices "was associated with decreased odds of a subsequent short-interval pregnancy."

        Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed an executive order Tuesday requiring a newly formed coalition of private-public entities to draft policies to address faults in Arkansas' foster care system. Under the order, Every Child Arkansas, a network of state agencies, faith-based organizations and foster care advocates, is tasked with finding ways to recruit more foster care parents, connect families with social services and create preventive strategies to keep children out of foster care, Sanders said during a news conference. "This executive order will have a major direct impact on the foster care system here in Arkansas," she said. "It's the first of many steps we're planning to take." By cutting processing times and speeding foster family licensing, Sanders expects the initiative to place children in homes in less than two months. The program also aims to increase the transparency of the foster care system and deputize a foster advocate to help foster families in each county, Sanders said. Lawmakers, advocates and foster families crowded the governor's conference room to watch Sanders and other officials affiliated with Every Child Arkansas deliver remarks. Before Sanders signed her order, Dr. Phil Goad, a member of the executive council for Every Child Arkansas, announced the official launch of the foster care network's website. "It will raise awareness of the need for foster care and adoptive families in our state," he said. "This magnificent new online resource will be telling encouraging stories of success and provide opportunities for Arkansans across the state to volunteer and learn more about foster care." The Every Child Arkansas network aims to ensure Arkansas has "more than enough" foster families, adoptive families and support for biological families, Goad said. The coalition includes state agencies within the Arkansas Department of Human Services and organizations such as CASA for Children, CarePortal, Children's Homes Inc., Project Zero and others.

         The Arkansas Senate State Agencies and Governmental Affairs Committee on Tuesday advanced a bill that would require the secretary of state to permit and arrange the placement on the state Capitol grounds of a suitable monument commemorating "unborn children aborted" during the era of the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court ruling under Roe vs. Wade. With Sen. Clarke Tucker, D-Little Rock, dissenting, the Senate committee sent Senate Bill 307 by Sen. Kim Hammer, R-Benton, to the full Senate. If enacted, the measure would be known as the "Monument to Unborn Children Display Act." The bill also would create a state trust fund to be known as the Monument to Unborn Children Display Act Fund. The fund would consist of gifts, grants and donations from individuals and organizations as provided under the bill and other funds as may be provided by law, and would be used only for erecting and maintaining the monument. The Capitol Arts and Grounds Commission would oversee the selection of the artist and design of the monument with input from pro-life groups under the bill, and the secretary of state would have final approval of the selection of the artist and design of the monument selected by the commission before any construction begins. Upon approval of the artist and design, the secretary of state would be required to arrange for the construction, placement and dedication of the monument on the state Capitol grounds by private entities at no expense to the state under the bill. If the legality or constitutionality of the monument is challenged in court, the attorney general may either prepare and present a legal defense of the monument, or request that a private law firm serve as counsel to prepare and present a legal defense of the monument under the bill.

        Arkansas and 14 of its cities will be allocated portions of roughly $44 million in annual grants for affordable housing, community development, and homeless assistance, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced Monday. The states funding is part of $5.6 billion HUD is distributing to 1,200 communities across the country. The money is targeted through five separate programs and not every city receiving grants will receive money from every program. Arkansas is only receiving funds through four of the programs. “Viable communities must promote integrated approaches to develop decent housing, suitable living environments, and expand economic opportunities to the most vulnerable,” said HUD Secretary Marcia L. Fudge in a press release. “These funds allow communities to address their unique needs by prioritizing what matters most to their residents and letting them own their investments in community development through these important federal resources.” Arkansas is slated for $17.8 million via the Community Development Block Grants, an annual grant for states, cities, and counties for providing decent housing and a suitable living environment, and by expanding economic opportunities, principally for low- and moderate-income people. The 14 cities -- West Memphis, Texarkana, Springdale, Rogers, Pine Bluff, North Little Rock, Little Rock, Jonesboro, Jacksonville, Hot Springs, Fort Smith, Fayetteville, Conway and Bentonville -- will all receive funds from the grant, with Little Rock the only one receiving more a million dollars at $1.4 million. According to HUD, in 2022 the program helped more than 60,000 families through housing activities, 46,000 individuals through job creation or retention, 83,500 people experiencing homelessness through improvements to homelessness facilities, more than 5.3 million people through public services, and over 39 million people through public improvements. Arkansas is getting $10.5 million from the HOME Investment Partnerships Program. HOME is a tool used by states and local governments to produce affordable rental and owner-occupied housing for low-income families. HUD reported that in 2022 the program helped create more than 15,000 units of housing and nearly 17,000 households were assisted with tenant based rental assistance through HOME program. Pine Bluff ($268,888), North Little Rock ($396,150), Little Rock ($844,274), Fayetteville ($512,642) and Fort Smith ($462,538) are the only Arkansas cities also receiving HOME funding. Arkansas is receiving $2.3 million in Emergency Solutions Grants. This funding is dedicated for homeless shelters, assisting in the operation of local shelters, and funds related social service and homeless prevention programs. Each year, the program connects more than 350,000 people to emergency shelters as they transition to permanent housing. Arkansas ($1.4 million) and Little Rock ($1.03 million) will be allocated funds for Housing Opportunities for Persons With HIV/AIDS (HOPWA). The program provides stable and permanent housing assistance and supportive services to low-income people living with HIV. More than 100,000 households receive HOPWA housing assistance and/or supportive services annually. Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court has begun hearing arguments in a partisan legal fight over President Joe Biden's plan to wipe away or reduce student loans held by millions of Americans. The high court, with its 6-3 conservative majority, heard arguments on Tuesday on two challenges to the plan, which has so far been blocked by Republican-appointed judges on lower courts. Arguments were scheduled to last two hours but were likely to go much longer. The public can listen in on an outside link or the court's website. Twenty-six million people have applied, and 16 million have been approved to have up to $20,000 in federal student loans forgiven, the Biden administration says. The program is estimated to cost $400 billion over 30 years. “Im confident the legal authority to carry that plan is there,” Biden said on Monday, at an event to mark Black History Month. The president, who once doubted his own authority to broadly cancel student debt, first announced the program in August. Legal challenges quickly followed. Republican-led states and lawmakers in Congress, as well as conservative legal interests, are lined up against the plan as a clear violation of Biden's executive authority. Democratic-led states and liberal interest groups are backing the Democratic administration in urging the court to allow the plan to take effect. Without it, loan defaults would dramatically increase when the pause on loan payments ends no later than this summer, the administration says. Payments were halted in 2020 as part of the response to the coronavirus pandemic. The administration says a 2003 law, commonly known as the HEROES Act, allows the secretary of education to waive or modify the terms of federal student loans in connection with a national emergency. The law was primarily intended to keep service members from being worse off financially while they fought in wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Nebraska and other states that sued say the plan is not necessary to keep the rate of defaults roughly where it was before the pandemic. The 20 million borrowers who have their entire loans erased would get a “windfall” that will leave them better off than they were before the pandemic, the states say. Dozens of borrowers came from across the country to camp out near the court on a soggy Monday evening in hopes of getting a seat for the arguments. Among them was Sinyetta Hill, who said that Biden's plan would erase all but about $500 of the $20,000 or so she has in student loans. “I was 18 when I signed up for college. I didnt know it was going to be this big of a burden. No student should have to deal with this. No person should have to deal with this,” said Hill, 22, who plans to study law after she graduates from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee in May. Biden's plan could meet a frosty reception in the courtroom. The court's conservatives have been skeptical of other Biden initiatives related to the pandemic, including vaccine requirements and pauses on evictions. Those were billed largely as public health measures intended to slow the spread of covid-19. The loan forgiveness plan, by contrast, is aimed at countering the economic effects of the pandemic. The national emergency is expected to end May 11, but the administration says the economic consequences will persist, despite historically low unemployment and other signs of economic strength. In addition to the debate over the authority to forgive student debt, the court also will confront whether the states and two individuals whose challenge also is before the justices have the legal right, or standing, to sue. Parties generally have to show that they would suffer financial harm and benefit from a court ruling in their favor. A federal judge initially found that the states would not be harmed and dismissed their lawsuit before an appellate panel said the case could proceed. Of the two individuals who sued in Texas, one has student loans that are commercially held and the other is eligible for $10,000 in debt relief, not the $20,000 maximum. They would get nothing if they win their case. A decision is expected by late June.  Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        Benton Police on Monday announced the arrest of a Hot Springs woman they believe was involved in the Jan. 15 hit-and-run that killed 13-year-old Zarious Evans of Benton. Jerrica Speed, 28, has been arrested and charged with leaving the scene of an accident involving death or serious injury, negligent homicide and obstructing governmental operations, a news release from the department said.  She was issued a $5,000 cash/sheriffs bond, the release said.  Authorities also said three juveniles are facing curfew violations and other misdemeanor charges related to the hit-and-run. The identity of the juveniles and information about the other charges were not immediately released.  Evans was found dead in the 19000 block of South Service Road just before 7 a.m. on Jan. 15, after police received a call about an unresponsive boy in the area, the release said.  A Jan. 17 news release identified Speed as the driver of the black Nissan Pathfinder involved in the crash and said she had contacted authorities about it.

         FAYETTEVILLE -- A rezoning proposal for about 15 acres on the northeast side of town gained support from the Planning Commission on Monday despite opposition from residents concerned about the environment, traffic and neighborhood character. Commissioners voted 5-2 to support rezoning 14.7 acres southeast of Oak Bailey Drive and Old Wire Road. The easternmost portion of the land includes the floodplain along Niokaska Creek. The City Council will have final say on the rezoning. If approved, it would change most of the land, about 9½ acres, from a residential single family zone allowing up to four units an acre to a neighborhood conservation zone. A neighborhood conservation zone allows the same residential uses as the current zone but with smaller lots, shorter setbacks from the right of way and higher density. The property could be developed under the current zoning with 32 dwellings, while rezoning to neighborhood conservation would allow up to 95 dwellings, said Donna Wonsower, city planner. The request also would realign the split zoning boundaries to match the floodplain, leaving 5.75 acres as undeveloped natural area. Mitch Weigel with Downtown Properties said the rezoning is intended to increase opportunities for housing in the city. Seven people spoke to the commission in opposition to the request, both in person and online. Mary Anne Kull, who lives nearby, said she didn't want to see the forested area lost and wanted to see an environmental impact study. "Our densely wooded paradise could be transformed into a dense development," she said. Commission Chairwoman Sarah Sparkman supported the request and said the land could already be developed under the current zoning. Many of the public concerns seemed to center around the land being developed at all, she said. "We need more housing in Fayetteville, and we cannot achieve it just by cramming it all into downtown and way off the dead end of Wedington," Sparkman said. "We have to look at other places closer to the center of town." Commissioners Andrew Brink, Mary McGetrick, Porter Winston and Matt Johnson joined Sparkman in supporting the rezoning. Commissioner Jimm Garlock voted against the rezoning and said he believed the request was not in line with the city's future land use map and was incompatible with existing nearby neighborhoods. Mary Madden joined him in voting against. Commissioner Joseph Holcomb recused from the vote. Commissioner Quintin Canada was absent Monday. In other business, commissioners voted 8-0 to approve a development plan for Pigskin RV Park on 43½ wooded acres southwest of Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard and Finger Road. The plan includes 165 recreational vehicle parking stalls, community pool, pavilion, sports courts, playground, dog park and bathrooms. Taylor Lindley with Crafton Tull presented the proposal to the commission and said the Army Corps of Engineers and Federal Emergency Management Agency will inspect environmental aspects of the project. Farmington Branch, which is part of the Illinois River watershed, bisects the eastern portion of the site. Commissioners in October granted changes to the project's conditional land use permit that allowed additional amenities. Planning staff received public comment at the time expressing concerns over the impact to the environment, traffic and the potential for trespassers on nearby private property. Lindley said the project will have fencing around it, creating a sort of gated community. Additionally, commissioners split a pair of requests related to Cobblestone Farms, an attainable housing project northeast of Wedington Drive and 54th Street. The development plan for the project includes 108 residential units. The development plan expired, and the commission agreed to extend it for a year by an 8-0 vote. A second request involved removing a tree preservation area from the northeast portion of the site. Lindley presented both requests to the commission and said the tree preservation easement could pose complications for a future phase of development. The request to remove the tree preservation area from the project was denied 5-3. Holcomb, Sparkman, Johnson, Garlock and Madden voted to deny. Brink, Winston and McGetrick voted in favor. Commission action Fayetteville's Planning Commission met Monday and approved: A preliminary plan for eight homes on Cherry Street from Habitat for Humanity. A conditional land use permit for Scooter's Coffee to operate at 1519 S. School Ave. Rezoning just more than 2 acres on the west side of Gregg Avenue near Patricia Lane from residential multifamily up to 24 units an acre to allowing up to 40 multifamily units per acre.

        A bill intended to create criminal penalties for a person who knowingly remains in a bathroom of the opposite sex while a minor is present passed a Senate panel Monday. Senate Bill 270, by Sen. John Payton, R-Wilburn, advanced from the Committee on Judiciary in a 5-2 roll call vote. The panel's Democratic senators, Clarke Tucker of Little Rock and Stephanie Flowers of Pine Bluff, were the two detractors. The vote sends the bill to the full Senate for further consideration. Payton said his bill was needed to protect minors from being "exposed to something they shouldn't be exposed to." "It does not make it illegal to go into the wrong facility as assigned to your sex, but it does make it illegal to knowingly remain in there if there's a minor present," he said. Five people testified against the bill and one person spoke in favor of it. Opponents said the bill would create the most restrictive ban on bathroom use for transgender people in the nation while doing little to protect minors from sexual abuse. Critics also questioned how officials would verify an accused person's sex and enforce the bill's provisions. Payton said his bill does not specifically target transgender people but would also apply to "perverse heterosexuals." The legislation would generally criminalize instances where a person 18 or older knowingly "enters into and remains in a public changing facility that is assigned to persons of the opposite sex while knowing a minor of the opposite sex is present in the public changing facility." Under the bill, a person would be guilty of a misdemeanor the first two times they violated the section. Subsequent offenses would be classified as felonies, Payton said. Before the vote on the bill, Tucker said the measure was the latest example of the Legislature failing to "scrutinize bills in the manner that it should." He said the bill would put "going into a bathroom, using the bathroom and leaving" on par with existing state law intended to protect minors from acts of sexual abuse. "No, I don't think this bill is covering going into a bathroom, using the bathroom and leaving," Payton said. "It's choosing to use the wrong bathroom while minors are present." Payton noted that a minor may be exposed to persons in "a state of undress" in changing facilities. "If you're going to use the wrong facility, then you have a responsibility to make sure the other people are out of the way and are not exposed," he said. Sarah Everett, American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas policy director, said the legislation would be "the most extreme bathroom ban" in the nation if passed. "There is no other state that has a criminal ban against transgender people using the restroom whether or not a minor is present," she said. Everett noted the bill does not address criminal activity or intent to harm. In addition to affecting transgender people, the bill also could affect women who look masculine or have mastectomies, she said. When asked if he was aware of any instances where a child was threatened by someone using a bathroom intended for the opposite sex, Payton said he was not aware of any "on the public record." Some constituents have said it was a concern at restaurants and gas stations, he said. Rumba Yambu, executive director of Intransitive, a transgender support organization, said lawmakers should shift their focus to legislation aimed at protecting children from sexual assault by non-strangers. "I've worked with sexual assault survivors for years," he said. "It's always the same, whether they are children or adults, it's always someone close to them." Luke McCoy of the Family Council spoke for the bill, saying his organization had worked with Payton on the measure. "We think this a bill that could have been in use in previous situations, may be just a few, but nonetheless even if there aren't any this is a proactive bill," he said. Tucker questioned if criminal penalties would apply to a person who used a bathroom of the opposite sex and remained in the bathroom after a minor entered it. Payton said it would depend on the prosecutor's discretion and on how long the person remained in the restroom. "Even if you're sitting in a stall?" Tucker asked. In that instance, Payton said an attorney might claim the person was in a separate room. If a person is "behaving" themselves while in a restroom of the opposite sex, Payton said they would be unlikely to face prosecution under his bill. "It's going to be really hard for someone to prosecute you over this bill. You have to prove 'knowingly' and 'remains,'" he said. "It definitely is a tool in the toolbox for the prosecutor or for the employee or for the other patrons to demand somebody change their behavior and don't hang out in the bathroom." Jessica Disney, a transgender woman, spoke against the bill, saying transgender people already face harassment when appearing in public. "I've been followed into a restroom at the beginning of my transition by both men and women seeing me, demanding that I not continue walking forward or they would call the police on me or subject me to violence," Disney said. "I've had death threats sent to me and posted on the door of my own home because I am simply transgender." Tucker questioned how law enforcement and prosecutors might verify a person's sex if the person were accused of violating the provisions of Payton's bill. "In order to be prosecuted under this crime, will the defendant have to expose their sex organs," he asked. Payton said officials might draw blood from a defendant to test their chromosomes. Among other exceptions, the bill provides exemptions for parents accompanying minors, people rendering medical assistance, law enforcement officials accompanying a person in their custody and people authorized to maintain and inspect facilities. Another bill intended to restrict transgender people from using the bathroom of their choice at public schools was pulled from the Senate floor earlier this month to allow for amendment. House Bill 1156, by Rep. Mary Bentley, R-Perryville, would require public schools and open enrollment public charter schools to restrict people from using a restroom that does not correspond with the sex listed on their birth certificate.

        More public debate regarding Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders' proposed omnibus education bill is needed before it goes to a vote before the House of Representatives, leaders representing four state advocacy groups said Monday. Representatives of the Arkansas Public Policy Panel, Arkansas Citizens First Congress, Arkansas Education Association and Disability Rights Arkansas voiced concerns about Senate Bill 294, also known as the Arkansas LEARNS Act, and its quick journey through the Legislature during a news conference at the Arkansas Education Association building in Little Rock. "Combining all of these changes into one omnibus and rushing this legislation through so quickly makes it seem as though there's an effort to limit debate on perhaps the most sweeping overhaul of our state's education system in recent memory," said Olivia Gardner, education policy director with Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families. The 144-page bill was filed Feb. 20 and cleared the state Senate just four days later. The bill heads to the House Education Committee today for a public hearing and could pass the full House as early as Thursday. House Education Committee Chair Brian Evans, R-Cabot, said the committee will wait until Wednesday to take action. If voted out of the House on Thursday, the bill would have to head back to the Senate for a concurring vote before it goes to the Republican governor for her signature. "This is about accountability, transparency and collaboration," said Carol Fleming, president of the Arkansas Education Association. "Why do we have to push a bill through so quickly that has taken, as we've been told, two years to develop? So you've had two years to develop something you want to push through with less than a week's time to the public." All of the speakers on Monday said they agree with some parts of the bill and are pushing for it to be amended. Bill Kopsky, executive director of the Arkansas Public Policy Panel and Arkansas Citizens First Congress, said his group has a number of suggested amendments, including extending the bill's long list of mandates on public schools to private and charter schools. "There are components of this legislation that I will simply never agree with, but I do think even with that there are improvements that we can make to make this more palatable for folks," Gardner said. The bill's sponsor, Rep. Keith Brooks, R-Little Rock, filed an amendment late Friday afternoon that will add back some due process protections for teachers after the bill repeals the Teacher Fair Dismissal Act, the state law that requires educators be given written notice before being fired. Brooks' amendment would require school districts to issue a "notice of a recommendation for termination" for fired teachers and "an opportunity for a hearing before the public school district board of directors." The amendment, which came at the request of Sen. Kim Hammer, R-Benton, also includes language that requires a discussion of a "school safety assessment, to be done in a closed session." Brooks told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette on Monday that he has no plans to amend the bill further. When asked earlier whether Sanders was open to amending the bill further, Alexa Henning, a spokeswoman for the governor, said Sanders and the bill's sponsors "have been open to amending the bill throughout the process." "We took hundreds of edits based on feedback from legislators, teachers, administrators, and parents," Henning said in a statement Saturday. "We have been engaging legislators all week on improvements to the bill and yesterday the final amendment was filed." Kopsky said the public has been misled. "This bill is being sold as a public education bill about literacy, and that's not the way that we read the bill," he said. "We read the bill as actually not having very much to do with public education, other than dismantling an awful lot of it and privatizing it in the form of vouchers and a massive expansion of charter schools that we've not talked enough about." Kopsky said he saw two components of the bill that focus on literacy, and he said both are partially funded. "We think what this bill really is, is a school privatization bill," he said. "We should just call it that, and we should just peel out the parts around public education and run a separate 'improving public education' bill." Kopsky also said the bill contains a provision that would "coerce, encourage, really push schools that are rated D and F into entering into contracts with for-profit companies or private charter operators." He said that provision would affect more than 300 schools in the state that have a D or F rating, and that most of those schools are ranked so low because of poverty. "The largest indicator of a student's performance in school, by far, is family income," Kopsky said. He said overall the bill needs to focus on funding more evidence-based solutions and provide clear expectations about the long-term cost of reforms. During the bill's hearing in the Senate Education Committee, the bill's sponsor, Breanne Davis, R-Russellville, defended the legislation against charges that it is an attack on public education, saying "nothing about this bill defunds public schools." Instead, Davis pointed to financial data from the Department of Education showing $297 million in spending, with $150 million in new spending, that she said will go toward educating students. RURAL STUDENTS Fleming, with the Arkansas Education Association, said SB294 would hurt students attending rural schools. Even if a voucher covered their tuition, many of those students do not have transportation to schools other than the public school they are zoned to attend, she said, adding that those students would not benefit from the school choice that proponents of Arkansas LEARNS say it offers. Tom Masseau, director of Disability Rights Arkansas, also expressed concerns about transportation. He said alternate transportation, even ride-share programs, would not be accessible for all. Fleming pointed out the proposed bill did not benefit from educators' input, saying she contacted Sanders' campaign before Sanders was elected but has yet to meet with the governor. Fleming also noted the bill's lack of written support and pay raises for other school employees, including classroom support staff, nurses, nutrition workers, social workers and bus drivers. "Intent is all well and good, but if it's not written [in the bill] they don't have to be held accountable to it," she said. All four speakers agreed the $50,000 starting salary for teachers that would be implemented if the bill becomes law would place a financial burden on rural and small schools as well. Masseau said the proposed legislation does not include certain provisions for students with disabilities. More specifically, he said, it doesn't provide for the training of school resource officers in making threat assessments and responding to mental health crises. "We agree, at Disability Rights Arkansas, that we need a strong education system to provide for all Arkansans as they leave high school to pursue their hopes and dreams," Masseau said. "However, in reviewing the LEARNS bill proposed by Gov. Sanders and Senator Davis last week, those opportunities are not provided to students with disabilities." Gardner, with Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, said the bill fails to address early childhood education, too. "My work focuses on early childhood education, and I believe this bill does not go far enough to address the crisis facing our state," she said. "There is no money in this bill for increasing access and affordability for childhood education."

        CAMDEN -- Lockheed Martin has faced a surge in demand for its weapons because of the war between Russia and Ukraine, and the company is continuing a recruiting effort in south Arkansas to expand its workforce. The number of employees at Lockheed Martin's complex is set to eventually exceed 1,200, up from about 600 in 2018. Lockheed Martin faces competition for local talent, but Site Director for Camden Operations Aaron Huckaby said Monday the company anticipates increasing its staff by an additional 200 employees over the next five years. The area near Camden is home to the largest concentration of aerospace and defense companies in Arkansas, including Raytheon Technologies and Aerojet Rocketdyne. There are 100,000 potential workers living in a region that includes Camden, El Dorado and Magnolia, he said. "If you look at our historical record, we're very well positioned to meet the demand," Huckaby said. "So I don't feel that there's a lot of pressure on us to be able to meet it. I think that we're very well positioned to meet the demand either at 200 or if things increase, then we'll still be very well positioned." Russia's invasion of Ukraine a year ago heightened the call for Lockheed Martin's battlefield weapons systems. The company produces about four M270 Multiple Launch Rocket Systems per month, or 48 per year, with no current plans to increase that number, Huckaby said Monday during a media tour at the Camden facility. The company was producing 48 HIMARS, or High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, annually at the beginning of 2022, increasing that number to 60 units, until the U.S. Army asked the company to increase production capacity to 96 units per year -- eight units per month -- by the end of 2024. The company is well on its way to meeting that production target without necessarily hiring all 200 projected future employees just for HIMARS production, Huckaby said. Huckaby said the company is looking to add an additional shift on HIMARS production to meet the 96 annual unit goal. Current Department of Defense contracts have the Camden factory replenishing weapons stocks for the U.S. military and for U.S. allies, officials said, to cover for weapons already sent to the front lines in Ukraine. Some of the HIMARS trucks will go directly to Ukraine. The Camden facility currently operates one 10-hour shift a day, four days a week. "The second shift would be a night shift or an alternative shift, maybe a Friday through the weekend," Huckaby said. Ouachita Partnership for Economic Development Executive Director James Silliman said there have been more concerted efforts in recent years to increase a local pool of skilled workers who can work in aerospace and defense jobs in the area. "It's kind of a joint effort that we're all working on and trying to address, to increase that workforce here," Silliman said. "There's probably been more of a concerted effort than there has been in the past. Lockheed is expanding their facility footprint here to service different contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense, so as a result of that, there's kind of an ongoing effort to ramp up hiring," Silliman said. State government and economic development groups have recently been gathering feedback about how to retain and recruit employees for companies like Lockheed; housing is one issue, Huckaby said. "Highland Industrial Park is looking at being a partner within that solution, daycare is another thing you don't always think of," Huckaby said. Staffing at the Camden facility has roughly doubled over the past five years. There were 1,047 employees at the Camden facility at the end of 2022, up from 594 employees in 2018; 655 employees in 2019; 829 employees in 2020; and 974 employees in 2021. At the Camden facility, 45% of employees have an associate degree or higher and 12% have a military background. Thirty-four percent of Camden's assemblers are also female; women could be seen on the floor performing precision-focused jobs throughout the facility on Monday. "One thing a lot of people comment on is the number of female operators that we have out on the line, especially on our launcher side," Huckaby said. The company participates in recruiting efforts at Southern Arkansas University and the University of Arkansas. "[We are] looking for mechanical engineers, manufacturing engineers, chemical engineers that can fill that demand," Huckaby said. Lockheed Martin also hosts family engagement nights for K-12 students, and its Camden Manufacturing Apprentice Program started at Southern Arkansas University Tech in East Camden in 2020, which allows cross-training across production areas and programs. "We have a lot of different STEM activities that we do at all grade levels to draw that interest because we recognize not everyone wants to go to college, some people might have a career path right out of high school and we want them to have those opportunities," Huckaby said. Huckaby said these programs are about getting the message to Arkansas' youth that the image of manufacturing has changed. "It's just to show the kids at a very early age that this isn't a manufacturing that the other generations were accustomed to, it's very high tech, it's a very clean environment, and there's a lot of robotics and automation, things that speak to their passions." Lockheed Martin also works with nearby Louisiana Tech University in Ruston, La., to attract engineering students and support staff. Automation technology is also being used to improve efficiency and meet increased production demand in Camden. In October, Lockheed Martin announced the opening of a new 85,000-square-foot All-Up Round III facility to support increased production of PAC-3 missiles for the Patriot missile system, taking production from 350 to 500 missile segment enhancements. Assembly robots in the PAC-3 program have helped increase efficiency on the line.  Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         FAYETTEVILLE -- The Advertising and Promotion Commission on Monday authorized leases for the historic Walker-Stone House and the Town Center. Commissioners voted 5-0 on a separate pair of proposals, one to lease the Walker-Stone House to Folk School of Fayetteville, and the other to renew the lease with the city for the Town Center. The lease with Folk School of Fayetteville is for $1 annually for two years. The lease for the Town Center is rent-free to the commission for 10 years with an automatic renewal every six months following expiration of the agreement. The commission bought the Civil War-era Walker-Stone House west of the downtown square in 2016. The city owns the Town Center and has leased it to the commission since 1998. The commission earlier this month discussed leasing the Walker-Stone House to Folk School of Fayetteville, the nonprofit group behind Fayetteville Roots. Commissioners supported the idea. Molly Rawn, chief executive officer of the city's tourism bureau, Experience Fayetteville, came back with a lease for commissioners to consider Monday. Bernice Hembree, one of the founders of Fayetteville Roots, last month described the idea for the property as being similar to Folk School of KDHX in St. Louis. Folk School of KDHX says on its website its mission is "to build community by providing educational programs that promote the learning, teaching, renewal and perpetuation of traditional music and folk arts." Under the agreement, Folk School of Fayetteville will pay $1 annually to rent the house starting Wednesday and lasting until Feb. 28, 2025. The commission agreed to pay up to $8,000 in utility costs -- specifically water, sewer, trash, electricity and gas -- for Folk School of Fayetteville for the first year, with the nonprofit group paying its own utilities in the second year. Additionally, Folk School of Fayetteville asked for first right of refusal for sale of the property. In other words, if someone makes an offer to the commission to buy the house, Folk School of Fayetteville could choose to buy the property first under the same terms. Commissioners agreed to give Folk School of Fayetteville 10 business days to consider such an offer if one were to happen. Rawn said she is not looking to put the house on the market, but the commission would need to consider any significant offer it might receive as good stewards of taxpayer money. The commission receives half of the city's 2% hotel, motel and restaurant sales tax revenue, with the other half going to parks. The commission authorized Rawn to present the proposal for first right of refusal to Folk School of Fayetteville and sign it if the nonprofit agrees to the terms. Separately, the commission will provide Folk School of Fayetteville $30,000 to cover startup programming costs. The money will be given in two installments. The first $15,000 will be provided once the lease is finalized. The other $15,000 will be provided after Folk School of Fayetteville presents an operating plan to the commission. The lease between the city and commission for the Town Center is largely the same, Rawn said. Under the new agreement, the leases for the Town Center and the center's parking deck will become one. Merging the two leases will make them easier to manage, she said. Additionally, repairs and upgrades for major features of the Town Center, such as the roof and air-conditioning units, will be the city's responsibility. The commission will continue to be responsible for routine maintenance and utility costs. The commission recently negotiated with the city to upgrade the center's roof so solar panels could be installed. The new lease also clarifies the terms regarding duration and renewal. Either party can call a meeting to propose changes to the agreement over the course of the 10 years. The lease will automatically renew with the same terms every six months if no action is taken, said Taylor Kelley, outside counsel to the commission. The language in the original lease was unclear and no one noticed it had expired more than a year ago, she said. Commission Chairman Todd Martin said he wasn't thrilled with some of the language of the new agreement but supported it overall. "I feel like this is a very good outcome for the A&P Commission," he said. The City Council is tentatively scheduled to discuss the Town Center lease March 21.

         FAYETTEVILLE -- Washington County's justices of the peace will be looking at up to $20 million in requests for federal covid relief money, with the county having earmarked just $2.3 million in funding. The Quorum Court's County Services Committee on Monday heard a report on the initial review of applications for funding from the American Rescue Plan Act. The panel took no action on the requests. County Judge Patrick Deakins said his office will be sending out more detailed information on the requests to the justices of the peace beginning today. The county received about $46 million in American Rescue Plan Act funds. The Quorum Court agreed last year to make available about $2.3 million in funding to nongovernmental groups and set up an application process. The application period closed at the end of October, and the applications received were sent to the Northwest Arkansas Economic Development District in Harrison to be reviewed for eligibility for the federal funds. According to information from the county, there were 46 applications received during the process with the total amount requested approaching $30 million. Catherine Baker with the Northwest Arkansas Economic Development District, said the district narrowed the applications down to 11 that met the guidelines of their review. Those 11 applications included requests totalling about $20 million. The initial applications ranged in size from $10,000 to more than $8 million and come from long-established charities like the Ronald McDonald House and the Lions Club to organizations including the Washington Water Authority, which submitted four requests ranging from $2.4 million to more than $8 million. The Washington Water Authority's requests total about $20 million. The distribution process for the American Rescue Plan Act funds was a bone of contention for several months with some nonprofit groups noting the Quorum Court awarded money to some groups without any process in place to accept and evaluate requests. The county allocated about $2.9 million to Upskill NWA for a job-training program to address shortages of qualified employees in health care and another $315,000 to Returning Home, a Springdale nonprofit group helping men who have been incarcerated reintegrate with the community. The use of relief funding for an expansion of the county's Detention Center has also raised questions. The justices of the peace in December approved two ordinances appropriating about $18.8 million in relief money for an expansion of the Detention Center. Some justices of the peace and community activists have questioned whether the jail project is an eligible use for the funds. A petition drive aimed at blocking the two spending ordinances failed to gather enough signatures in the allotted time to force a special election on the ordinances. Also on Monday, the justices of the peace discussed the need for a county emergency operations center. John Luther, the county's emergency services director, told the justices of the peace the office is now housed in a temporary location in Lincoln, using a satellite training facility of the Arkansas Fire Academy. Luther said the county had an emergency operations center in what is now the Northwest Arkansas Crisis Stabilization Unit. When that building was designated for use for the crisis stabilization unit, his office and the emergency operations center were moved to the county's annex building, but that space is now being used by Circuit Judge Diane Warren. Luther said Washington County stands alone among the state's larger counties in having no permanent emergency operations center. He said the center is used to bring together and coordinate different agencies and governments in time of emergencies like tornadoes or flooding. The center would be used at other times for training and to provide conference and office space. "The center is the hub of business related to emergencies," Luther said. "It helps the responders do the jobs they need to do out in the field." Luther said an emergency operations center should have room to house all of the local emergency response agencies and additional space for state or federal agencies that may need to have people in the county to deal with an emergency situation. Deakins said the county needs to address the issue of having no permanent facility for emergency management and after some discussion told the justices of the peace he saw enough of a consensus among them to begin working on the project. The justices of the peace took no action on the matter Monday.  American Rescue Plan Act Washington County received more than $46 million in American Rescue Plan Act money in 2021 and 2022. The American Rescue Plan provides $350 billion in federal money for eligible state, local, territorial and tribal governments nationwide to offset the impact of the covid-19 pandemic, according to information from the Treasury Department.

        Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders will appoint obstetrician-gynecologist Kay Chandler to serve as Arkansas' next surgeon general, Sanders announced Monday. Chandler has served as an obstetrician-gynecologist at Cornerstone Clinic in Little Rock since 1997 and has been included on the national Best Doctors Inc. list since 2005, the governor's office said in a news release. Sanders said Chandler will bring strong leadership and years of medical expertise to the state Department of Health. "Dr. Chandler is a skilled, qualified OB-GYN who has spent decades serving women across Arkansas," the Republican governor said in a news release. "I promised that when I was elected governor, Arkansas would not have mask mandates or vaccine mandates and we would not shut down churches and schools because we believe in personal freedom and responsibility," Sanders said. "I look forward to working together to protect the health, well-being and individual freedoms of Arkansans." Chandler replaces the state's former surgeon general, Greg Bledsoe, who submitted his resignation to Department of Health interim Secretary Renee Mallory in a letter dated Friday. "It has been my privilege to serve the people of Arkansas as the surgeon general for this wonderful state these past eight years," Bledsoe wrote in his letter to Mallory. "Wishing you and your colleagues at the Arkansas Department of Health all the best as you continue to work on behalf of our state to further health and health care for all Arkansans." Former Gov. Asa Hutchinson, a Republican, appointed Bledsoe as the state's surgeon general in 2015. Bledsoe was part of state government's response to the covid-19 pandemic in 2020, warning Arkansans in late March to take the virus seriously by social distancing and quarantining as necessary. In May 2022, Bledsoe lost a bid for the Republican nomination for lieutenant governor to current Lt. Gov. Leslie Rutledge, who is the state's former attorney general. Bledsoe announced his resignation on Twitter on Friday afternoon, saying, "I wish [Gov. Sanders] & her admin. tremendous success as they lead our state. I know they will do an excellent job." He had a $173,199 management consulting contract with the state Department of Health for the current fiscal 2023, according to the Arkansas Transparency website. Bledsoe said Monday in a text message to the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette that he is the medical director of the emergency department at St. Mary's Regional Health System in Russellville, and the chief executive officer of ExpedMed, a medical education company that directs the Expedition Medicine National Conference. Chandler has been named the best obstetrician-gynecologist by Little Rock Family Magazine and AY Magazine, according to the governor's office. She graduated with a bachelor's degree in chemistry from Hendrix College, received her doctor of medicine degree from University of Texas Southwestern Medical School in Dallas, and completed her residency training at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. Chandler is dedicated to promoting health and wellness through true lifestyle change and has served as medical director of Ideal Health NOW! since 2011, according to the governor's office. She shares new women's health care information on the medical Monday segment on THV11's morning show, "THV This Morning," and currently serves on the board for the Pulaski County Medical Society and on the board of trustees of the Arkansas Medical Society. She is married to her husband of 30 years, dentist Jeffrey K. Chandler, who serves the Little Rock area at Chandler Family Dentistry.  Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         FORT SMITH -- Police have identified the body of a man that was found in and recovered from the Arkansas River near Harry E. Kelley River Park on Sunday. Aric Mitchell, police spokesman, wrote in a news release Monday his department's preliminary investigation identified the man as Jose Molina-Portillo, 43. There were reportedly no immediate signs of foul play. Molina-Portillo's body was sent to the Arkansas State Medical Examiner to determine cause and manner of death, according to Mitchell.

         FAYETTEVILLE -- A Tennessee man pleaded not guilty in Washington County Circuit Court on Monday to robbing a Fayetteville bank in January. Danny Ray Madison, 57, of Nashville, Tenn., was arrested in connection with the Jan. 10 robbery, according to information from the Fayetteville Police Department. Madison is charged with aggravated robbery and theft of property, according to court documents. He was given an initial court date of July 5 before Circuit Judge Mark Lindsay. Officers were called to First Security Bank at 3443 W. Wedington Drive at 8:39 a.m. Jan. 10, according to police. Madison went into the bank and took an undisclosed amount of money before leaving, police said. He threatened bank employees with a gun and kept one hand in his pocket, according to a preliminary report. He handed an employee a bag and demanded money from both of the bank tellers' cash drawers, the report said. Madison left the bank and walked through the parking lot near the Walmart Neighborhood Market just south of the bank, police said. Officers began a search of the area, and an employee at a nearby motel said he believed a man matching the photograph taken during the robbery had been there the previous night. He identified the man as Madison. Madison was found on surveillance video from the Jefferson Bus Lines building at 3075 W. Wedington Drive. A clerk at the bus terminal said Madison had been in the building asking about a bus ticket. The clerk said Madison left the bus station in a taxi but left a backpack at the bus station. Police said investigators began watching the bus station and saw a taxi enter the parking lot with Madison inside. Madison entered the bus station and was taken into custody. Police said Madison was wearing clothing that matched those in the bank robbery photos and had a large amount of cash in his pockets. Police said Madison admitted to investigators he robbed the bank on Wedington Drive, and he had come to Fayetteville with the purpose of robbing a bank. According to the report, Madison told police he had told the bank clerks he had a gun but didn't actually have one during the robbery. Police said Madison has a history of other bank robberies with prior convictions in 1995, 2002 and 2012.

        It was pharmacist Gwendolyn Herzig's first time testifying before a legislative committee when she spoke to several Arkansas lawmakers in a packed hearing room this month about a bill restricting gender-affirming care for minors. Herzig, who is transgender, spoke against the legislation and told the panel that one of the biggest obstacles trans people face is a lack of empathy. A few minutes later, a Republican lawmaker asked her a question about her genitalia. "It was horrifying," Herzig said. The exchange, which was livestreamed on the Legislature's website and has since been widely shared on social media, is an example of the type of questions and rhetoric that transgender people meet when they show up to statehouses to testify against new bills targeting their rights. In South Dakota, a lawmaker invoked "furries" -- people who dress up as animals -- when talking about gender-affirming care. In Montana, a legislator compared parents supporting their children in finding treatment to asking doctors to carry out medically assisted suicide. Advocates worry that increasingly hostile rhetoric about transgender people could have a chilling effect on those who want to speak out against new restrictions and could do lasting damage to a community of trans youth that is already marginalized. "I feel like that's what they're trying to do, to keep us from coming and exercising this right that we have," said Rumba Yambu, executive director of Intransitive, an advocacy and support group for transgender people in Arkansas. "Because who wants to go and be asked about their genitalia in front of a bunch of strangers? Especially strangers in power." So far this year, at least 150 bills targeting transgender people have been introduced nationally, which is the highest in a single year, according to the Human Rights Campaign. Bans on gender-affirming care for minors have already been enacted this year in South Dakota and Utah, and Republican governors in Tennessee and Mississippi are expected to sign similar bans into law. Arkansas and Alabama have bans that were temporarily blocked by federal judges. The push has included efforts in some states to restrict gender-affirming care for adults and proposed bans on drag shows that opponents have warned would also discriminate against transgender people. Herzig came to the state Capitol to testify against a bill that would make it easier to file malpractice lawsuits against providers of gender-affirming care to minors. In her testimony, Herzig talked about working with transgender patients who are on hormone replacement therapy. "Bills like SB199 are designed to hinder, not help, Arkansans by creating barriers to evidence-driven health care they deserve under the guise of helping the young and innocent," Herzig said, later adding that a vote for the bill was "unpatriotic, and casts doubts on our own health and research institutions who have worked through health care fields to improve the lives of Americans." During follow-up questions, Republican Sen. Matt McKee asked Herzig if she is transgender. When she said yes, he asked: "Do you have a penis?" The question was met with jeers and audible gasps in the packed committee room. "That's horrible," Herzig responded, telling McKee that asking her such a question was inappropriate and noting she was testifying as a health care professional. "I had never been so publicly humiliated in my life," Herzig told The Associated Press in an interview days later. McKee did not respond to an email or phone call, but defended his question in a written statement. "As a father of 4 daughters, I will do everything in my power to protect my children and the children of Arkansas, especially from the woke mob who intend to push their agenda and beliefs down our throats and destroy our families," McKee's statement said. The idea of protecting children by withholding medical care is undermined by health experts who have said minors with gender dysphoria who do not receive appropriate care face dramatically increased risk of suicide and serious depression. McKee's questions were similar in tone to those posed to Debi Jackson's teen Avery, who is transgender and nonbinary, when they testified before Missouri legislators last year about a proposal to ban trans girls and women from participating on sports teams matching their gender identity. During the hearing, a lawmaker asked Avery if they were "gonna go through the procedure." Since that exchange, Jackson said Avery hasn't wanted to testify again before the Legislature. "It's this same idea that in any of these discussions about trans people just being treated with basic dignity and respect, legislators want to reduce them to one body part," Jackson said. "They miss the entirety of the human being sitting in front of them having a conversation." Advocates say the rhetoric surrounding these proposed bans further exacerbates the problem of an already treacherous environment for transgender people, their families and medical providers. Children's hospitals around the country have faced an uptick in harassment and threats of violence for providing gender-confirming care. Though she said she's received an outcry of support since her testimony, Herzig said she and the pharmacy she owns have gotten hateful emails and calls. People opposed to gender-affirming care for minors argue that children are too young to make decisions about their futures, sometimes comparing such treatments to child abuse. That's despite medical experts' saying the care is safe when administered properly. Nearly every major medical group, including the American Medical Association, has opposed the bans on such care for minors. Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott last year ordered the state's child welfare agency to investigate reports of gender-affirming care for children as abuse, but a judge has since blocked those investigations. Amber Briggle, the mother of a transgender teenager in Texas whose family was investigated after Abbott's order, said she gets frustrated when speaking before lawmakers in her state who she believes already have made up their minds on the issue. But Briggle said she plans on returning to Texas' Capitol this year, and that Herzig's encounter motivates her even more to show up and speak out. "They should not have to fight this alone," Briggle said of transgender people testifying in statehouses. "They should know they have loving, supporting allies in their corner." Herzig said she probably would not have testified had she known she was going to be asked about her genitalia. "I felt like I was pretty much prepared for any combative question," she said. "Except that."  Print Headline: Trans people face 'horrifying' rhetoric at statehouses Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        A Serbian national indicted in a far-ranging investigation into gang violence and drug trafficking in Central Arkansas believed to be centered on two rival street gangs was arraigned Monday in federal court after his arrest last month in New Jersey. Nenad "Nash" Steljic, 34, a native of the Republic of Serbia, was indicted in November by a grand jury in Little Rock along with 25 other people for alleged involvement in drug trafficking and other activities that investigators with the FBI's GETROCK Task Force have attributed to a street gang known as Lodi Murder Mobb. A tandem FBI investigation into the activities of a rival gang -- EBK, which stands for Every Body Killas -- resulted in an additional 35 people indicted, although three defendants were named in both indictments. FBI investigators said the two gangs were responsible for what they termed "a pipeline" of drugs and guns flowing between Little Rock and Pine Bluff. According to court records, Steljic was arrested in late January by police in Wayne, N.J., and appeared for a bond hearing before a magistrate judge in the federal District of New Jersey on Jan. 20, where he was ordered to be transported to Arkansas. "A grand jury for the Eastern District of Arkansas has charged you in an indictment with two felony counts," U.S. Magistrate Judge Edie R. Ervin told Steljic as she opened the hearing. "You're charged with other defendants in Count 1 with conspiracy to distribute and possession with intent to distribute 100 kilograms or more of marijuana ... If you're convicted of that charge, the maximum statutory penalties that may be imposed are not less than five years or more than 40 years in prison, a fine of not more than $5 million, and supervised release not less than four years." The other count he faced, Ervin said, is use of a communications device in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime, for which she said the maximum penalties are four years in prison, a $250,000 fine and one year on supervised release. "When I say those are the maximum statutory penalties," Ervin explained, "those are the most you can get if you are convicted. You need to also understand that the federal sentencing guidelines are likely to play a role in any sentence you receive in this case and you may want to discuss with your attorney what the guidelines are, how they work and how they could impact your case." Ervin appointed Little Rock attorney Annie Depper to represent Steljic. Depper entered an innocent plea for Steljic and requested a jury trial, which has been set for March 27 before U.S. District Judge Kristine G. Baker. Assistant U.S. Attorney Amanda Fields told Ervin the government requested that Steljic be held in federal custody until his case is resolved. "It's also my understanding that there's an immigration hold on Mr. Steljic," Fields said. "I believe, after a brief reading of the pre-trial services report, there is a detainer," Depper said. "But, I would like to reserve the right to the possibility of a bond hearing in the event that possibility opens up for us." Ervin said she would reserve Steljic's right to a bond hearing at a later date and ordered him returned to federal custody. According to court records, including Steljic, 15 people named in the FBI's Lodi Murder Mobb indictment have been ordered to remain in custody, nine have been released pending trial, and two -- Eric Lozano, 28, of Dallas, Texas and Milka "Ace Boogie" Bell, 27, of Benton, are considered to be fugitives and are subject to a nationwide search by law enforcement.

        North Little Rock Mayor Terry Hartwick gave his annual State of the City address at the North Little Rock City Council meeting Monday.   [Video not showing up? Click here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRV1Jc5q7WI] Over the past year, he said, the city has broken ground on a new health care clinic in Rose City, built a new fire station in Burns Park, opened a new pump track, started a new Municipal Identification Program to equip citizens, demolished the old Greyhound Bus station to allow for more growth downtown and began street and drainage work on Faulkner Lake Road among other projects. The Rose City health care clinic was a $4 million investment, promising over 20 jobs. The partnership with Baptist Health is the first full-service medical facility in the east part of the city since 2013. Troy Wells, CEO of Baptist Health, said the relationship with North Little Rock dates back to the 1960s and the two have had a "tremendous" partnership since. The half-cent sales tax that passed helped fund renovations for fire stations across the city, as well as a new four-story training tower and a memorial for line-of-duty deaths. The pump track at Burns Park saw visitors from across the state enjoy biking, skateboarding and roller skating. David Larson, owner of Angry Dave's Bicycles, said "we're not even close to finished yet." Raul Fernando, director of Seis Puentes at the Municipal Identification Program, said since the start of the ID program in June of 2022, over 500 applicants have applied for an ID. Mary Beth Bowman, director of city services, said after the demolition of the Greyhound Bus station the city's downtown area will see major changes to the landscape in the next two to five years. It's an asset to have vacant property which is city-owned and privately-owned, she said. Faulkner Lake Road was made accessible after being closed for the better part of a year due to flooding. Marie Hollowell, president of the Stone Links Neighborhood Association, said the improvements will enhance the community and make their new disc golf course more available to visitors. "I take pride in how hard our city employees work for our citizens and the spirit of community we all share," Hartwick said. "North Little Rock continues to be a leader in economic development in Central Arkansas and in our state. I am looking forward to what the future holds in 2023 for the City of North Little Rock."

        Philander Smith College has been awarded nearly $3 million to improve high-speed internet access. The $2,999,903 grant from the Connecting Minority Communities pilot program -- which is run by the U.S. Department of Commerce's National Telecommunications and Information Administration and is part of the Biden administration's Internet for All initiative -- was announced Monday by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration. Philander Smith College is one of 61 minority-serving colleges and universities to receive these grants, which total $175 million. With this latest set of grants, all funding from the Internet for All grant program has been awarded to 93 universities, including 43 Historically Black Colleges and Universities, 24 Hispanic Serving Institutions, 21 Minority Serving Institutions, and five Tribal Colleges and Universities, according to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration. The Connecting Minority Communities pilot program is part of the administration's Internet for All initiative that aims to connect everyone in America with affordable, reliable high-speed internet service. The project's goal is to improve, upgrade and expand the use of technology on campus with a focus on innovation to enhance student learning and provide more effective administrative functions for faculty and staff, according to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration. Philander Smith College will "implement campus enterprise-level resources, refreshing technology for both students and employees, purchase internet access service, install and upgrade broadband facilities, improve wireless connectivity on campus, and purchase eligible equipment and devices for student and community resident use." The college will also "provide one-to-one devices for freshmen students, prioritizing [those] in need, provide Wi-Fi hotspots for students, and anchor community residents who participate in [Philander Smith]-led workforce development and community engagement programs," according to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration. "The proposed Wi-Fi hotspot lending program will allow community residents to check out technology for their own educational purposes," too. "Access to affordable, reliable, high-speed Internet service is necessary for minority students and local communities to fully access school, healthcare, and jobs," Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo said in a National Telecommunications and Information Administration news release. "The Department of Commerce has made significant investment into minority-serving colleges and universities, and I am proud to say that all funding from the Connecting Minority Communities program has been distributed to help make internet connectivity a reality for tens of thousands of students at minority-serving colleges and universities across the country." Founded in 1877, Philander Smith College is one of the oldest private, historically Black institutions of higher learning in the state, according to the college. The liberal arts college is affiliated with the United Methodist Church and is the only United Negro College Fund member school in the state. Current enrollment is approximately 700, according to Sericia Nelson, executive strategist at the college. In the latest U.S. News & World Report Best Colleges rankings, released last fall, Philander Smith College ranked 41st for regional colleges in the South and tied for 40th among national historically Black colleges and universities. According to the Encyclopedia of Arkansas, alumni include Dr. Joycelyn Elders, a former U.S. surgeon general; the Rev. James H. Cone, a professor at Union Theological Seminary in New York; Lottie Shackelford, the first woman to serve as Little Rock's mayor; former National Football League player Elijah Pitts; and former Harlem Globetrotters basketball player Hubert "Geese" Ausbie.

        A bill that would require state physical fitness instructors to complete training on how to recognize and respond to certain health conditions passed the Arkansas House on Monday. House Bill 1458, which would create the Vincent Parks Act if approved, passed 96-0 and advances to the Senate. The bill is intended to honor Parks, a Jonesboro police officer who died after training in extreme heat in July at the state police academy. "There's nothing that we can do that can bring officer Parks back," said the bill's sponsor, Rep. Frances Cavenaugh, R-Walnut Ridge. "But I do believe it is our duty to make sure we learn from this tragedy." The bill would require physical fitness instructors responsible for training law enforcement officers, firefighters and Arkansas Game and Fish Commission officers to receive certification on recognizing and managing dehydration and concussions. Instructors also would have to complete training on environmental issues that could threaten the health or safety of a person by causing heat exhaustion or sudden cardiac arrest. Parks, 38, died after training for about 25 minutes in extreme heat, an Arkansas State Police investigative file revealed. State officials initially released a statement saying Parks hadn't participated in physical activity before his death. It took nearly a month after multiple questionings of officials to correct the statement. Following Parks' death, Arkansas State Police launched a criminal investigation that resulted in no action. A complaint against the Arkansas Department of Public Safety and training academy employee Joe Duboise was recently filed with the Arkansas Claims Commission by Parks' attorney, Jim Jackson. Damages are placed at $5 million in the complaint. Cavenaugh's bill would require physical fitness instructors to remove any cadet or officer who faints, loses consciousness or exhibits warning signs of cardiac arrest from training. A cadet or officer would be barred from returning to training until cleared in writing by a licensed physician. An instructor acting in good faith would not be liable for any act or omission under the bill unless the fault is intentional, reckless or grossly negligent. While presenting her bill, Cavenaugh recognized members of Parks' family who observed the House session from gallery seats. Christina Parks previously told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette that her husband had always wanted to be in law enforcement. The two met when Christina was 19 and Vincent was 20. Christina became pregnant soon after starting college. The couple decided she would stay in school, and Vincent would help take care of their daughter, Vivianna "Vivi" Parks, she said. Eventually, the couple was in a place financially and Vivi old enough for Vincent to pursue his dream. "He always wanted to be in law enforcement," Christina Parks said. "After a lot of late-night conversations, he decided to do it." She said a lot of the discussion about law enforcement revolved around Vincent's being a Black man. "He wanted to make a difference in our community," Christina Parks said. "Jonesboro is a small Southern town. In the back of his mind he thought this could be bad. He also wanted to help re-establish trust in the community." Mark Berry, R-Ozark, called Parks' death a "senseless tragedy" while speaking on the bill in the House. "Anytime that you lose somebody in a training environment it's a senseless act. That's exactly what happened to Officer Parks that day, which I believe could have been prevented," he said. Last month, Berry filed legislation that would make hazing at Arkansas Law Enforcement Training Academy a felony. Berry later said he didn't intend to move the bill forward after receiving assurances the academy will make its own policy on the issue. Berry filed the legislation a month after former Pulaski County prosecutor Larry Jegley brought forth concerns about hazing at the academy.

         Man shot in shin stopping car theft Little Rock police are investigating an incident Sunday that left one man suffering from a gunshot wound to his right shin, according to reports from the department. Police responded to the area of Rocco Drive just after midnight Sunday where they discovered Ian Dolphin, 40, suffering from a gunshot wound. A tourniquet was used by officers around Dolphin's leg before Metropolitan Emergency Medical Services arrived. Biance Reece, 28, was also on the scene with Dolphin when police arrived. Dolphin told police he was shot by two unknown men in an "older, silver Sedan" after coming outside to stop them from stealing Reece's car. Reece said bullets also entered the home, going through the window and a television inside. According to the report, the two suspects immediately fled the scene, driving southbound on Rocco Drive. Upon further investigation, officers located several shell casings on the front porch, two projectile strikes in Reece's "other" vehicle and "possibly" a plastic holster. Dolphin was transported to a nearby hospital for treatment. His condition is unclear at this time. Police apprehend woman in robbery Little Rock police on Sunday arrested a woman on charges of robbery and theft, according to daily reports from the department. Shakenna Lewis, 36, is facing charges after reportedly throwing a woman to the ground and physically assaulting her Sunday afternoon near West 12th Street. One witness told officers that Lewis would not stop slamming the victim against the ground until she threatened to call the police. Lewis fled the scene with some of the victim's belongings but was stopped by a second witness who "rushed" her with his dog, according to the report. The witness said she handed over the victim's belongings and continued walking east down West 12th Street. Lewis was later arrested in connection to the incident, as well as a parole warrant.

         Lissa Muscatine, a former White House speechwriter who led the drafting of first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's speech to the Fourth U.N. World Conference on Women in a suburb of Beijing on Sept. 5, 1995, will talk about the speech at 6 p.m. Wednesday at the Clinton Presidential Center in Little Rock. In 1995, women from around the globe gathered in Beijing for the Fourth U.N. World Conference on Women. Some in the administration and Congress did not want her to speak, expressing concern that it would affect diplomatic relations with China. Even some human rights activists did not want Clinton to go. They thought her presence would be viewed as a sign of conciliation with a hostile regime. Clinton flew to Beijing anyway, delivering a speech that some historians say did two things: it helped galvanize the women's equality movement and it became part of a theme she referenced in the decades ahead as she pursued her own political career. The Clinton Presidential Center event Wednesday is titled "'Women's Rights Are Human Rights, Once and For All': The Story of a Speech." Mike Hemphill, director of Leadership Development at the Clinton Foundation, will facilitate the conversation. The event will be held in person and livestreamed from Sturgis Hall on the Clinton Presidential Center campus. Registration is required for in-person and virtual viewing at https://bit.ly/3EFer6O.

        The Pine Bluff School District will need to campaign for an increase in one or both of its millage rates to generate enough funds toward a high school construction project that could lose state funding if not finalized by next January. Ray Beardsley, a financial adviser for the district, made that recommendation publicly to the district's board during a regular monthly meeting Monday. The district in July 2021 was approved for a $24 million high school project that would cover 116,489 square feet, with the state covering 53% of the cost, or $12,817,259 ($110.03 per square foot), and the district to cover the rest. Since then, construction costs have escalated to about $300 to $350 per square foot, while the PBSD has lost $2,594,550 in state funding due to a loss of 350 students from last school year, Beardsley said. School administrators across Arkansas are petitioning the state Legislature to increase their funding in cost-share agreements toward facility upgrades. If the cost of construction is $300 per square foot, the total cost would be $34,946,700, leaving the PBSD to cover $22,129,441 plus a $500,000 equipping cost. At $350 per square foot, the cost would rise to $40,771,150, leaving the PBSD to fork over $27,953,891 plus the equipping cost. Beardsley informed the board that the PBSD and state Education Secretary Jacob Oliva must decide by May 10 and have signed all necessary documents by then to put a millage question on the Aug. 8 ballot. For the question to be placed on the Nov. 14 ballot, the parties must decide by Aug. 25 and have the documents signed, but Beardsley cautioned that might push against the deadline to finalize the project. Oliva makes all final approvals of board actions, since the PBSD is operating under a limited-authority board. The district is funded by two millage rates due to the July 2021 annexation of the Dollarway School District. Property owners in the former Dollarway district pay taxes at a rate of 40.8 mills, and those in the former PBSD zone pay taxes at a rate of 41.7 mills. Shawn Carroll of East Harding Construction informed the board the project is based on space replacement of buildings at Pine Bluff High that are at least 50 years old. Among the current buildings scheduled for demolition, the Trice, Arts, Patterson, McGeorge and ROTC buildings would total 189,854 square feet. Curry promotes welding program Former Watson Chapel School District Superintendent Andrew Curry, now director of governmental affairs with transformer manufacturer Central Moloney Inc., pitched a skills trade and manufacturing program that promotes welding education in the district. Curry was superintendent when Central Moloney forged a partnership with the WCSD to start the program for this school year, and 11 of the 19 students in that program will graduate this year with the promise of a job at Central Moloney, Curry said. Top readers Assistant Superintendent Phillip Carlock acknowledged the PBSD's top readers, or those who read the most books for the second grading quarter: From Broadmoor Elementary: Brayshawn Leach (grades K-1), De'Adjah Williamson (2-3) and Daylan Wiley (4-6); from Southwood Elementary: Khari Mickens (K-1), Raivyn Williams (2-3), Jakarion Franklin (4-6); from Thirty-Fourth Avenue Elementary: Jace Moore (K-1), Damien Crump (2-3), Malajah Gatewood (4-6); from Jack Robey Junior High: Haley Price; from Robert F. Morehead Middle School: Kaylen Pittmon; and from Pine Bluff High: Remeia Smothers. Beating the Odds Morehead, Dollarway High, Pine Bluff High and Jack Robey received honors from the Office for Education Policy at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, as schools that are "Beating the Odds" because students demonstrated high growth on the ACT Aspire, even though the schools serve a high percentage of students who participate in free and reduced lunch. Personnel moves The district hired Rhonda Johnson as a paraprofessional at Pine Bluff High and rehired Pamela Ervin as administrative assistant to the superintendent. Resignation letters were accepted from security officer Ontario Allen, James Matthews Elementary secretary Erica Kaiser, Dollarway High social worker Ashley Steward and Matthews health aide Jaleesa Woods. Addenda were approved for Matthews assistant principal Tamika Freeman-Taylor, Matthews library media specialist Lavoris Martin and Jack Robey assistant principal Tamika Wright. Contracts were renewed for assistant superintendents Kelvin Gragg and Carlock, and paraprofessional Takelia Liddell was transferred from Jack Robey to Matthews.

         James L. "Skip" Rutherford III has donated a collection of Black history books to the Lyon College Mabee-Simpson Library for its Black History Collection. The titles in his collection relate primarily to Black culture and history, as well as to the lives of influential Black American leaders, according to the college. Rutherford -- a Batesville native who is a member of the Lyon College Board of Trustees and has served as a visiting professor at the college -- made the donation in recognition of the 50th anniversary of the Lyon College Black Student Association and Black History Month. "It wasn't until my own children started school that I realized just how little I knew about Black history," Rutherford said in a statement with an announcement by Lyon College on Monday evening. "In addition to expanding the Lyon College Black History Collection, it is my hope these books will provide primary source learning opportunities and academic research for Lyon students." Rutherford and his wife, Billie, have three children who were educated in the Little Rock School District. He served on the Little Rock School Board from 1987-1991, and he coordinated the creation of the William J. Clinton Presidential Center, working with various officials to include what is now a museum, presidential library and the University of Arkansas Clinton School of Public Service in the River Market District area of downtown Little Rock. He is Dean Emeritus of the University of Arkansas Clinton School of Public Service in Little Rock. Rutherford, 73, worked with Lyon College Digital Media Librarian Aidan Sonia-Bolduc to curate the collection. Among the 20 new titles included in the collection are "A Promised Land" by Barack Obama, "Black Fortunes" by Shomari Wills, "Caste" by Isabel Wilkerson, "The 1619 Project" by Nikole Hannah-Jones, "The Hate U Give" by Angie Thomas, "The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness" by Michelle Alexander, "The Three Mothers: How the Mothers of Martin Luther King, Jr., Malcolm X, and James Baldwin Shaped a Nation" by Anna Malaika Tubbs, and "The Vanishing Half" by Brit Bennett. "In today's climate, the history of African Americans in the United States is a story many do not want to be reminded of, but without our true history, how can we move forward?" said Branndii Peterson, Lyon College executive director of TRIO programs designed to help students from disadvantaged backgrounds and Black Student Association adviser, in the college's news release about the donation. "Trustee Skip Rutherford understands the parallel and the need to make sure our students know this part of history."

         Two separate crashes Sunday left a Helena-West Helena man and a Mountain Pine man dead, according to preliminary reports from Arkansas State Police. Larry Savell Jr., 46, of Helena-West Helena, died in a single-vehicle incident Sunday just before 2 p.m. while traveling in Sebastian County, according to one report. The report said Savell was traveling northbound on Arkansas 85 when his 2004 Chevrolet Venture left the roadway before overturning. No other injuries were reported. Police described the weather as cloudy and the road as dry at the time of the wreck. Mountain Pine resident Frederick Bergey died Sunday about 9 p.m. in Garland County while traveling near Arkansas 227. The report says Bergey, 33, exited the roadway to the right and traveled "down the roadside" before re-entering the roadway and repeated this once more, exiting the roadway on the left. Bergey then left the roadway again one more time -- rotating clockwise, skidding off the right side of the road and crashing his 2005 Jeep into a tree. One boy was also injured in the wreck. The boy's name and age were not identified in the report, but he was transported to CHI St. Vincent Hospital for treatment. The weather was described by police as clear with wet roads during the time of the wreck.  Print Headline: Single-vehicle crashes kill two in state Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        An unsuccessful Democratic candidate for the state House of Representatives, Christopher Wolcott of De Queen, has agreed to pay a $50 fine and receive a public letter of caution from the Arkansas Ethics Commission as part of a settlement of an ethics complaint against him, according to Arkansas Ethics Commission records. Wolcott signed a settlement in which he agreed to a finding by the commission that he violated Arkansas Code Annotated 7-62-203 as a candidate in House District 87 during the 2022 election cycle by accepting contributions from two limited liability companies, commission Director Graham Sloan said in a letter dated Feb. 22 to Wolcott. Campaigns cannot legally accept contributions from limited liability companies, Sloan said. Evidence gathered during the course of the investigation reflected that Wolcott's campaign accepted three contributions from Randy Walker, M.D., P.L.L.C., and one contribution from AHW, LLC, Sloan said. He said Wolcott immediately returned the contributions from the limited liability companies after receiving the ethics complaint. Wolcott lost to Republican state Rep. DeAnn Vaught of Horatio in the Nov. 8 general election.  Print Headline: Wolcott pays $50 ethics fine Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         Corrections bill sent to governor The Arkansas Senate on Monday gave its final approval to a bill that would specify that the secretary of the state Department of Correction serves at the pleasure of the governor. After concurring with a House amendment to the bill, the Senate voted 34-0 to send Senate Bill 194 by Sen. Bart Hester, R-Cave Springs, to Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders. Existing state law is that "The state Board of Corrections shall appoint the secretary who shall serve at the pleasure of the Board of Corrections." Under the amended bill, SB194 would become effective on the date of its approval by the governor. -- Michael R. Wickline House to look over board's race quota The Arkansas Senate on Monday approved a bill that would strip a requirement under state law that the nine-member Arkansas Social Work Licensing Board have no fewer than two African-American members. The Senate voted 26-7 to send Senate Bill 264 by Sen. Missy Irvin, R-Mountain View, to the House for further consideration. Irvin said Attorney General Tim Griffin's office brought up issues with requiring the board to have at least two African-American members under state law. Sen. Linda Chesterfield, D-Little Rock, said current state law requires people of color to be on the board because they previously had been left off the board, and a court has not ruled the state law to be unconstitutional. Irvin responded by reading the emergency clause of the bill that states in part that "It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that the current membership makeup of the Arkansas Social Work Licensing Board contains an unconstitutional racial requirement that requires the Governor to meet a racial quota when appointing members to the Arkansas Social Work Licensing Board when similarly qualified Arkansas citizens would not be considered to fulfill any open positions until the racial requirement has been met. ..." Afterward, Griffin said in a written statement that "We worked with Senator Irvin on the amendment and appreciate her leadership in spearheading this legislation." The amendment to the bill includes the emergency clause. -- Michael R. Wickline Behavioral analyst bill passes House The Arkansas House passed a bill to license behavioral analysts Monday. House Bill 1189, by Rep. Nicole Clowney, D-Fayetteville, would like to create a state license for professionals who work with those who have autism and other intellectual and developmental disabilities. Clowney said Arkansas behavioral analysts wanted to have a state licensing regimen to provide more state oversight of the profession. The state license for behavioral analysts would be under the Arkansas Psychology Board, Clowney said. Currently, a national board oversees behavioral analysts in the state, Clowney said. The bill passed the House on a 56-24 vote and has moved to the Senate for further consideration. -- Neal Earley  Print Headline: Corrections bill sent to governor Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         FAYETTEVILLE -- TheatreSquared's co-production of "Russian Troll Farm" won a special citation at the Obie Awards in New York City on Monday night. The citation for digital, virtual and hybrid production -- innovative work while in-person gatherings were suspended because of covid-19 -- cited "Sarah Gancher (Writer), Jared Mezzocchi and Elizabeth Williamson (Directors) Russian Troll Farm (The Civilians, Theater Works Hartford, and TheatreSquared)," according to the Obie Awards website. The recognition is the first Obie Award associated with a theater in Arkansas, according to TheatreSquared. TheatreSquared said in a news release Monday that it supported playwright Sarah Gancher in developing "Russian Troll Farm" at the all-virtual 2020 Arkansas New Play Festival in June 2020, shortly after in-person performances were indefinitely postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic. In October, the company joined Theater Works Hartford, in association with The Civilians, to co-produce the new play's world premiere. The play will receive a live, in-person production this week with the same directing team at Geva Theatre Center in Rochester, N.Y., according to TheatreSquared. The Obie Awards -- created in 1955 at the suggestion of Jerry Tallmer of The Village Voice weekly newspaper -- acknowledges achievements of off-Broadway and off-off Broadway theater work. The first awards were presented in 1956. TheatreSquared is a regional professional theater in Fayetteville.

         BENTONVILLE -- The Walmart Foundation awarded a $1.5 million grant to the library expansion campaign at the Bentonville Library Foundation's annual donor appreciation lunch Sunday. "The Bentonville Public Library provides countless resources to the community that are well beyond books on the shelves," said Angela Oxford, senior manager NWA Region for Walmart.org. "The library provides spaces for innovation and community gatherings as well as summer nutrition programs -- all things that align with our purpose to help people live better." Walmart.org represents the philanthropic efforts of Walmart and the Walmart Foundation, according to a library news release. The library's new community room and expanded veranda will be named to honor the contribution, according to the release. "We are thankful to the Walmart Foundation," Library Foundation President Howard Kerr said. "Support for the library, as a public institution, is especially important in a growing community where people of all backgrounds are relocating for job advancement, educational pursuits, family opportunities and recreational options." The foundation grant brings the total amount of funds committed for the expansion to $15.3 million. The contribution will join the city bond money of $4.5 million toward the $16.75 million project, according to the release. A groundbreaking is scheduled for 1 p.m. April 27, according to the release.

        James L. “Skip” Rutherford III has donated a collection of Black history books to the Lyon College Mabee-Simpson Library for its Black History Collection. The titles in his collection relate primarily to Black culture and history, as well as the lives of influential Black American leaders, according to the college. Rutherford — a Batesville native who is a member of the Lyon College Board of Trustees and has served as a visiting professor at the college — made the donation in recognition of the 50th anniversary of the Lyon College Black Student Association and Black History Month. “It wasnt until my own children started school that I realized just how little I knew about Black history,” Rutherford said in a statement with an announcement by Lyon College on Monday evening. “In addition to expanding the Lyon College Black History Collection, it is my hope these books will provide primary source learning opportunities and academic research for Lyon students.” Rutherford and his wife Billie have three children who were educated in the Little Rock School District. He served on the Little Rock School Board from 1987-1991 and he coordinated the creation of the William J. Clinton Presidential Center, working with various officials to include what is now a museum, presidential library and the University of Arkansas Clinton School of Public Service in the River Market District area of downtown Little Rock. He is Dean Emeritus of the University of Arkansas Clinton School of Public Service in Little Rock. Rutherford, 73, worked with Lyon College Digital Media Librarian Aidan Sonia-Bolduc to curate the collection. Among the 20 new titles included in the collection are “A Promised Land” by Barack Obama, “Black Fortunes” by Shomari Wills, “Caste” by Isabel Wilkinson, “The 1619 Project” by Nikole Hannah-Jones, “The Hate U Give” by Angie Thomas, “The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness” by Michelle Alexander, “The Three Mothers: How the Mothers of Martin Luther King Jr, Malcolm X and James Baldwin Shaped a Nation” by Anna Malarkla Tubbs, and “The Vanishing Half” by Brit Bennett. “In todays climate, the history of African Americans in the United States is a story many do not want to be reminded of, but without our true history, how can we move forward?” said Branndii Peterson, Lyon College executive director of TRIO programs designed to help students from disadvantaged backgrounds and Black Student Association adviser, in the colleges news release about the donation. “Trustee Skip Rutherford understands the parallel and the need to make sure our students know this part of history.” Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Monday she will appoint Dr. Kay Chandler to serve as Arkansas' surgeon general. Chandler has served as an OB-GYN at Cornerstore Clinic in Little Rock since 1997 and has been named the best OB-GYN by Little Rock Family Magazine. Sanders said Chandler will bring strong leadership and years of medical expertise to the state Department of Health. “Dr. Chandler is a skilled, qualified OB-GYN who has spent decades serving women across Arkansas," Sanders said. "I promised that when I was elected governor, Arkansas would not have mask mandates or vaccine mandates, and we would not shut down churches and schools because we believe in personal freedom and responsibility. I look forward to working together to protect the health, well-being, and individual freedoms of Arkansans.” The state's former surgeon general Greg Bledsoe announced his resignation Friday afternoon on Twitter. Bledsoe had served in the post since 2015. He was appointed as the state's surgeon general by former Gov. Asa Hutchinson. Bledsoe lost a bid for the Republican nomination for lieutenant governor in May 2022. Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        More public debate over Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders proposed omnibus education bill, the Arkansas LEARNS Act, is needed, four leaders representing state advocacy groups said on Monday. Speakers with the Arkansas Policy Panel, Arkansas Citizens First Congress, Arkansas Education Association and Disability Rights Arkansas voiced various concerns over Senate Bill 294 and its quick journey through the Legislature at the Arkansas Education Association building in Little Rock.  The bill was filed on Feb. 20 and cleared the state Senate in less than one week.  “Combining all of these changes into one omnibus and rushing this legislation through so quickly makes it seem as though theres an effort to limit debate on perhaps the most sweeping overhaul of our states education system in recent memory,” said the education policy director with Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, Olivia Gardner.  “And this is about accountability, transparency and collaboration,” Carol Fleming, president of the Arkansas Education Association, added. “Why do we have to push a bill through so quickly that has taken, as weve been told, two years to develop? So youve had two years to develop something you want to push through with less than a weeks time to the public.” All of the speakers said they agree with some parts of the bill. But Bill Kopsky, executive director of Arkansas Public Policy and Arkansas Citizens First Congress, argued that the public had been misled about it.  “This bill is being sold as a public education bill about literacy, and thats not the way that we read the bill. We read the bill as actually not having very much to do with public education other than dismantling an awful lot of it and privatizing it in the form of vouchers and a massive expansion of charter schools that weve not talked enough about,” he said. Kopsky said he saw two components in the bill that focus on literacy, and he said both are partially funded. “We think what this bill really is is a school privatization bill, and we should just call it that,” he said. “And we should just peel out the parts around public education and run a separate ‘improving public education bill.”  Also, according to Kopsky, SB294 contains a provision that would “coerce, encourage, really push schools that are rated D and F into entering into contracts with for-profit companies or private charter operators.”  He said that provision would impact over 300 schools in the state that have a D or F rating. Kopsky said most of the schools are ranked so low due to poverty.  “The largest indicator of a student's performance in school, by far, is family income,” Kopsky said.  He said, overall, the bill needs to focus on funding more evidence-based solutions and provide clear expectations about the long-term cost of reforms.  RURAL STUDENTS  Fleming, with the Arkansas Education Association, said SB294 would hurt rural students. Even if a voucher covered their tuition, many of those students do not have transportation to schools other than the public school they are zoned to attend, she said. So those students would not benefit from the school choice that proponents of Arkansas LEARNS say it offers.  Tom Masseau, the director of Disability Rights Arkansas, was concerned about transportation, too. He said alternate transportation, even rideshare programs, would not be accessible for all. Fleming also pointed out that the proposed bill did not benefit from educators input. She said, as of noon Monday, she hadnt heard from the governor or the bills sponsor — Sen. Breanne Davis, R-Russellville — though she had tried to contact them several times.   Another concern Fleming voiced about the bill is its lack of written support and pay raises for other school employees, including classroom support staff, nurses, nutrition workers, social workers and bus drivers. “Intent is all well and good, but, if it's not written, they dont have to be held accountable to it,” she said. All four speakers agreed the $50,000 starting salary for teachers that would be implemented if the bill becomes law would place a financial burden on rural and small schools as well. DISABLED STUDENTS Masseau said the proposed legislation does not include certain provisions for students with disabilities. More specifically, he said it doesnt provide for the training of school resource officers in making threat assessments and responding to mental health crises.  “We agree, at Disability Rights Arkansas, that we need a strong education system to provide for all Arkansans as they leave high school to pursue their hopes and dreams,” Masseau said. “However, in reviewing the LEARNS bill proposed by Gov. Sanders and Senator Davis last week, those opportunities are not provided to students with disabilities.” EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION  Gardner, with Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, said the bill fails to address early childhood education, too.  “My work focuses on early childhood education, and I believe this bill does not go far enough to address the crisis facing our state,” she said. “There is no money in this bill for increasing access and affordability for childhood education.” Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        Lissa Muscatine, a former White House speechwriter who led the drafting of First Lady Hillary Rodham Clintons 1995 speech to the Fourth U.N. World Conference on Women, will talk about that speech at 6 p.m. Wednesday at the Clinton Presidential Center in Little Rock. Women from around the globe gathered on Sept. 5, 1995, in a suburb of Beijing, China, for the conference — to address the challenges women confronted. Some in the administration and Congress did not want Clinton to speak, expressing concern that it would affect diplomatic relations with China. Even some human rights activists did not want her to go. They thought her presence would be viewed as a sign of conciliation with a hostile regime. Clinton flew to Beijing anyway, delivering a speech that some historians say did two things: it helped galvanize the womens equality movement, and it became a part of a theme she referenced in the decades ahead as she pursued her own political career. The Clinton Presidential Center event on Wednesday is called "'Womens Rights Are Human Rights, Once and For All: The Story of a Speech.” Mike Hemphill, director of Leadership Development at the Clinton Foundation, will facilitate the conversation. The event will be held in person and live streamed from the historic, red brick Sturgis Hall on the Clinton Presidential Center campus.

        A bill intended to create criminal penalties for a person who knowingly remains in a bathroom of the opposite sex while a minor is present passed a Senate panel on Monday. Senate Bill 270, by Sen. John Payton, R-Wilburn, advanced from the Committee on Judiciary in a 5-2 roll call vote. The panels Democratic senators Clarke Tucker of Little Rock and Stephanie Flowers of Pine Bluff were the two detractors. The vote sends the bill to the full Senate for further consideration. Payton presented his bill as a measure needed to protect minors from being "exposed to something they shouldn't be exposed to." “It does not make it illegal to go into the wrong facility as assigned to your sex, but it does make it illegal to knowingly remain in there if there's a minor present,” he said. Five people testified against the bill and one person spoke in favor of it during the committee meeting. Opponents said the bill would put transgender people at risk of criminal prosecution for using public restrooms while doing little to protect minors from sexual abuse. Critics also questioned how officials would verify an accused person's sex and enforce the bill's provisions. Sarah Everett, policy directory for the American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas, said the legislation would be “the most extreme bathroom ban” in the nation if passed. Payton said his bill does not specifically target transgender people but would also apply to "perverse heterosexuals." The legislation would generally criminalize instances where a person 18 or older knowingly “enters into and remains in a public changing facility that is assigned to persons of the opposite sex while knowing a minor of the opposite sex is 10 present in the public changing facility.” Under the bill, a person would be guilty of a misdemeanor the first two times they violated the section, Payton said. Subsequent offenses would be classified as felonies, Payton said. Among other exceptions, the bill provides exemptions for parents accompanying minors, people rendering medical assistance, law enforcement officials accompanying a person in their custody and people authorized to maintain and inspect facilities.

        Crystal Ridge Distillery recently announced a distribution agreement with Arkansas Beverage Sales, which will expand the distillery's distribution to a total of 11 counties within the state. The facility, owned by Danny and Mary Bradley and managed by their son, Asher, distributed its ready-to-drink canned cocktails in Garland, Saline, Clark and parts of Pulaski counties prior to the agreement, which adds sales of the distillery's products in Pope, Hot Spring, Dallas, Calhoun, Ouachita, Cleveland, Van Buren and Conway counties. "This is going to expand our reach into 10 different counties," Danny Bradley said. "It will take over the Garland and Clark (counties' distribution) and then add in eight other counties, one of which is Hot Spring County that just went wet."   [Video not showing up above? Click here to watch » youtube.com/watch?v=4Coj_Fwr9QQ] The new agreement is significant for the distillery, and is "like being invited to join the Super Bowl-winning team," Danny Bradley said. "When you get invited to be a part of Arkansas Beverage and the Budweiser distributorship, which is number one in the world, that's a chance that you cannot pass up," he said. In 2021, Sen. Mark Johnson, R-Little Rock, introduced a bill to allow ready-to-drink products "containing spirituous liquor" with less than 15% alcohol by weight to be distributed under the state statute regarding beer, malt products or light wine. The bill was enacted as Act 578 on April 6, 2021. While the act did allow distributors to sell ready-to-drink canned beverages, Danny Bradley said it did not allow the distillery to sell them on their own. "We got representatives to sponsor a bill for us," he said. "That bill passed in a landslide that enabled the Arkansas distillers, if it was a native distillery, to distribute their spirits within the state of Arkansas, self-distribute. Crystal Ridge Distillery had a rough start with the covid-19 pandemic shutting down the state just five days after its grand opening on March 14, 2020. "Five days after our grand opening, we got shut down for covid," Mary Bradley said. "We converted to hand sanitizer. We were able to take our vodka and make sanitizer to help our community." Asher Bradley said the distillery had plans for canned drinks early on, even before the business opened its doors. "We actually purchased the (canning) machine behind us in '19, but cans during the pandemic kind of shut everything down," he said. "So we weren't able to do that. And then in late '20, we were able to start getting our initial order of cans, and then '21 was our first generation of -- you can still see a few of them floating around -- of our cans. And then this past year, we introduced our newest generation." The business will host a family-friendly anniversary event on March 25 at the distillery.

        Even the supporters of the governor's education bill asked questions and raised concerns Friday at forums in Northwest Arkansas. The Rogers-Lowell and Fayetteville chambers of commerce on Friday afternoon held their first forums between legislators and the public since the 144-page bill dropped this week. In the evening, the Arkansas Democratic Rural Caucus had a similar meeting at the Farmington Senior Center. "This bill is so broad and so much is in it," Suzanne Spivey, a member of the Rogers School Board, at the Rogers meeting. "Much of it is so wonderful, but I do have some concerns." Spivey was one of at least 30 attending a Conversations With Your Legislators event hosted by the Rogers-Lowell Chamber of Commerce in the chamber's conference room. "Vouchers, how is that going to work?" Spivey said. "Who's going to monitor them? Also, I know a lot of parents who are home school who do an excellent job, but who is going to monitor the new ones?" Sen. Jim Dotson, R-Bentonville, and other lawmakers at the Rogers forum assured Spivey and others that their questions would be addressed. A six-page amendment to the bill was filed in the House earlier on Friday, Dotson said. The governor unveiled the LEARNS Act proposal Monday. The measure passed the Senate on Thursday and is pending in the House. The bill would increase the minimum starting salary for teachers to $50,000 a year and create a voucher program, called Educational Freedom Accounts, that would allocate 90% of state per-student taxpayer funds for students to attend a private or home school. The bill would also repeal the Teacher Fair Dismissal Act, which would make it easier for school districts to fire teachers for poor performance. Many of the provisions such as the educational freedom accounts will be phased in, Dotson said. Also attending the Rogers event were Republican Reps. Brit McKenzie of Rogers, Rebecca Burkes of Springdale, Kendon Underwood of Cave Springs and Mindy McAlindon of Bentonville. Of the Friday events, the one in Farmington had the highest attendance, as well as the most open criticism of the education proposal. Kevin Shinn, Huntsville fire chief and a retired educator who worked in Huntsville schools for about 36 years, said the bill provides for state funding to raise teachers' pay up to $50,000 a year for two years. After that, he said, rural school districts will be left to fend for themselves. "The salary money is the carrot that's gotten everyone's attention," Shinn said. "But rural schools do not have the tax base to pick up the slack when the state steps down." Shinn said smaller, mostly rural school districts will have to make cuts. "They'll start cutting the athletic programs, cutting the arts programs, cutting the music programs," he said. Farmington forum panelist Jess Piper said she lived in Arkansas and attended Arkansas schools and universities before moving to Missouri. Missouri and other states including Arizona, Iowa and Michigan have already adopted legislation similar to what is now being considered in Arkansas. "It hasn't worked in any of those places," Piper said. Piper said Missouri teachers were promised raises, but the promises were not kept. "They lied," she said. "It was all smoke and mirrors." Jim Lewis of Lincoln attended the forum and said the loss of tax money when students leave a district, as allowed in the bill, will force smaller districts to consolidate. A former superintendent of the Lincoln School District, Lewis said smaller districts can't afford the loss of funding. "If you had 40 students transfer out of the Lincoln School District, that would cost the district about $260,000," Lewis said. "That may not seem like a lot to a city district, but it's a tremendous amount to a small district to have to make up. You still have to meet state standards for the number of teachers and the teacher-student ratio. You may have to cut programs and positions. You could cut things like the FFA [Future Farmers of America] program, cut coaching positions, cut transportation. It will make a large impact on the smaller schools." Gwen Faulkenberry attended the Farmington forum and is executive director of Arkansas Strong, a lobbying group against the bill. Faulkenberry said Arkansas Strong is trying to mobilize people to rally on the steps of the state Capitol Tuesday morning, when the LEARNS Act is scheduled for a hearing in the House Education Committee. "I'd say 75% to 90% of the discussion was about the LEARNS Act" at the Fayetteville chamber event, said Wayne Mays, senior policy for the Fayetteville chamber and organizer of its forum. "Several of the citizens there questioned the haste," Mays said. "They said they haven't had time to talk with legislators about it." Rep. Steve Unger, R-Springdale, also attended the Fayetteville event. He confirmed that much of the discussion was about the LEARNS Act and that even supporters had concerns. "The question we have to ask ourselves is, 'Is the status quo working?'" Unger said. "When you look at our rankings, the answer is clearly no." "We do not produce any perfect documents in that building," Unger said of the state Capitol. The LEARNS Act is a good bill but will not get everything right on the first pass, he said. Also, much of the bill will still be implemented by state policy and by district school boards in application, he said. Even the best bill needs sound implementation to succeed, Rogers School District Superintendent Jeff Perry told lawmakers at the Rogers forum. The LEARNS Act would be a lot to digest in the short amount of time it would take to implement, he said. Schools are three months from making their plans, schedules and pay schedules for the next school year, he said. "This is probably the most comprehensive education reform package I've ever seen in my life," Perry told lawmakers at the Rogers meeting. "We are supportive of the vast majority of this bill. Our biggest comment would be to let us help you make this bill a success," he said. Constituents and school districts need more of a partnership and more information, he added. Rogers resident Laura Rowland asked about a provision in the bill requiring students to commit to at least 75 hours of volunteer time to qualify for graduation. "I have a friend in Warren [Bradley County] where there aren't places to volunteer" for community service. And even in places with more opportunity, she said, this requirement could lead to the exploitation of youths as cheap labor.

         FAYETTEVILLE -- A Tennessee man pleaded not guilty in Washington County Circuit Court on Monday to robbing a Fayetteville bank in January. Danny Ray Madison, 57, of Nashville, Tenn., was arrested in connection with the Jan. 10 robbery, according to information from the Fayetteville Police Department. Madison is charged with aggravated robbery and theft of property, according to court documents. He was given an initial court date of July 5 before Circuit Judge Mark Lindsay. Officers were called to First Security Bank at 3443 W. Wedington Drive at 8:39 a.m. on Jan. 10, according to police. Madison went into the bank and took an undisclosed amount of money before leaving, police said. He threatened bank employees with a gun and kept one hand in his pocket, according to a preliminary report. He handed an employee a bag and demanded money from both of the bank tellers' cash drawers, the report said. Madison left the bank and walked through the parking lot near the Walmart Neighborhood Market just south of the bank, police said. Officers began a search of the area and an employee at a nearby motel said he believed a man matching the photograph taken during the robbery had been there the previous night. He identified the man as Madison. Madison was found on surveillance video from the Jefferson Bus Lines building at 3075 W. Wedington Drive. A clerk at the bus terminal said Madison had been in the building asking about a bus ticket. The clerk said Madison left the bus station in a taxi, but left a backpack at the bus station. Police said investigators began watching the bus station and saw a taxi enter the parking lot with Madison inside. Madison entered the bus station and was taken into custody. Police said Madison was wearing clothing that matched those in the bank robbery photos and had a large amount of cash in his pockets. Police said Madison admitted to investigators he robbed the bank on Wedington Drive, and he had come to Fayetteville with the purpose of robbing a bank. According to the report, Madison told police he had told the bank clerks that he had a gun, but did not actually have one during the robbery. Police said Madison has a history of other bank robberies with prior convictions in 1995, 2002 and 2012.

        A Mountain Pine man was killed and a boy was injured in a one-vehicle wreck late Sunday in the 3700 block of Mountain Pine Road, troopers said. Frederick Bergey, 33, of Mountain Pine, was driving a 2005 Jeep southbound on Mountain Pine Road around 9 p.m. when he reportedly exited the roadway to the right, traveled down the roadside and re-entered the roadway, according to a preliminary report from Arkansas State Police. Troopers said the vehicle reportedly exited the roadway to the left, traveled down the roadside and again re-entered the roadway before rotating clockwise and skidding off the right side of the road into a tree. Bergey was pronounced dead at the scene. A boy, whose name and age were not listed in the report, was injured and transported by LifeNet to CHI St. Vincent Hot Springs. Conditions were clear but wet at the time of the wreck, the report states. Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        Owens Corning, the building and construction materials maker based in Toledo, Ohio, announced plans Monday to build a 150,000-square-foot facility in Russellville that will bring 50 new jobs over the next two years, a news release said. “This new facility will advance our ability to create sustainable solutions in the building materials industry and better serve the growing needs of our customers,” Rodney Wideman, vice president and general manager of Foam Insulation, Owens Corning, said in the release. “We are excited to join the Russellville community and have appreciated the continued support and partnership with the State of Arkansas.” Production at the new factory is scheduled to start in Russellville in 2025. The company will make foam insulation there "for applications spanning commercial and residential building," the release said. The project will be Owens Cornings third expansion in two years in Arkansas. In February 2021, Owens Corning announced that it would build a new 550,000-square-foot manufacturing facility in Fort Smith to produce fiberglass composite materials. In October 2022, the company announced a second expansion at the Fort Smith facility to invest an additional $24.5 million for machinery and new construction that would lead to the creation of 50 new jobs, the release said. “The team at AEDC is pleased to once again work with Owens Corning and to welcome the company to Russellville,” said Clint ONeal, executive director of the Arkansas Economic Development Commission. “Russellville continues to make great strides toward becoming an even more attractive community to call home and operate a business, and today we celebrate the results of their efforts. My congratulations to the Chamber, Alliance, and local leaders for their work in attracting Owens Corning to the community.” Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         For 38-year-old Na'Keena Brown, a typical day involves everything from time with her family and horseback riding to directing funerals and inspecting missiles for global technology leader Lockheed Martin. Brown worked as a full-time funeral director at the Reddick Funeral Home in Camden for nearly 11 years before beginning her journey with Lockheed Martin at its Camden facility. Lockheed Martin Quality Director Janna Gillepsie shared insight on what Brown's current role entails as a senior inspector on the PAC-3 missiles. "Inspectors are the last line of defense Lockheed Martin has to make sure our products work the first time, every time," Gillepsie said. "They have to have extreme attention to detail, understand the product requirements and be dedicated to the mission of our customer. In [Brown's] future career journey as an engineer, she will touch each phase of a product's life cycle – from development to production through sustainment." Brown's time with Lockheed Martin began just three years ago when she joined through the Inspector Senior apprenticeship program. The apprenticeship program is a 3,000-hour time-based program supplemented by a minimum required 142 hours of core related instruction, according to Lockheed officials. Under the apprenticeship training, Brown "performs inspections using certified skills on both ground and flight electronic assemblies," representatives with Lockheed said. "These assemblies include cables, harnesses, sub-assemblies and final assembly of missiles and launchers. Inspectors will record inspection results and create electronic documentation for non-conforming hardware." The "about us" page on the company's website reads: "Lockheed Martin is a global security and aerospace company that employs approximately 116,000 people worldwide and is principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services." Data provided by Cristina Vite, a spokesperson for Lockheed Martin, shows that 40 people are registered in the apprenticeship program with Brown. It also highlights that Brown is part of the 72% of women inspectors in the program. "When I started at Lockheed Martin, I really became inspired by the products I was working on and it made me want to learn more about how they worked. I knew to become an engineer I would have to pursue a Bachelor's degree," Brown said. A Camden native, Brown is currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Engineering at Southern Arkansas University Tech. Lockheed Martin is assisting with Brown's tuition through the apprenticeship program. Gillepsie said the company's tuition reimbursement program allows it to support employees as they further their education. "When I first started the apprenticeship training program, I feared I was not going to be able to catch on and learn the skills since I did not have an engineering background," Brown told Lockheed in a prior apprenticeship highlight. "However, the instructors made the classes at SAU Tech fun, and the one-on-one training approach really helped with my confidence in my abilities." In an interview with an Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reporter, Gillepsie commented on Brown's impact at the Camden location. "The entire team loves [her] attention to detail and enthusiasm for her job," Gillepsie said. "She has a strong desire to learn and grow, and it's inspiring to see her aspire to always be better and grab the brass ring," Gillepsie said. "[She] works every day to support the U.S. and its allies." According to Brown, the decision to work for Lockheed years ago was one that came with ease. "Lockheed Martin is well known throughout the Camden community and I had always heard it was a great place to work," Brown said. "At the funeral home, there were limited opportunities to grow and I knew that Lockheed Martin had an apprenticeship program where I could increase my skills and start a new career journey. I began with [the] apprenticeship program, where they taught me the skills needed to succeed as a quality inspector." The Camden Lockheed Martin facility hires for chemical, mechanical and manufacturing engineers as well as assemblers and technicians. Representatives with the company said the goal is to continue to encourage and support community members seeking multiple career pathways. For Brown, her time at Lockheed allows her to spend days inspecting PAC-3 missiles at the Missiles and Fire Control Camden location, studying to be an engineer at SAU Tech and directing funerals on the weekend. At 38, she continues to offer her time and efforts to her hometown's Reddick funeral home while evolving in her role with Lockheed Martin and working toward her degree. Brown said her plans are to continue working alongside Lockheed Martin as she gets her degree, with plans to use her skills as an engineer in new ways with the company. "I want to inspire my children and others to always follow their own dreams. I want to be an example to them," Brown said. "My grandfather inspired me to dream big and go after the things that I wanted."  Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

        It was pharmacist Gwendolyn Herzig's first time testifying before a legislative committee when she spoke to several Arkansas lawmakers in a packed hearing room this month about a bill restricting gender-affirming care for minors. Herzig, who is transgender, spoke out against the legislation and told the panel that one of the biggest obstacles trans people face is a lack of empathy. Only a few minutes later, a Republican lawmaker asked her an inappropriate question about her genitalia. "It was horrifying," she said. The exchange, which was livestreamed on the Legislature's website and has since been widely shared on social media, is an example of the type of demeaning questions and rhetoric that transgender people meet when they show up to statehouses to testify against new bills targeting their rights. In South Dakota, a lawmaker invoked "furries" — people who dress up as animals — when talking about gender-affirming care. In Montana, a legislator compared parents supporting their children in finding treatment to asking doctors to carry out medically assisted suicide. Advocates worry that increasingly hostile rhetoric about transgender people could have a chilling effect on those who want to speak out against new restrictions and could do lasting damage to a community of trans youth that is already marginalized. "I feel like that's what they're trying to do, to keep us from coming and exercising this right that we have," said Rumba Yambu, executive director of Intransitive, an advocacy and support group for transgender people in Arkansas. "Because who wants to go and be asked about their genitalia in front of a bunch of strangers? Especially strangers in power." So far this year, at least 150 bills targeting transgender people have been introduced, which is the highest in a single year, according to the Human Rights Campaign. Bans on gender-affirming care for minors have already been enacted this year in South Dakota and Utah, and Republican governors in Tennessee and Mississippi are expected to sign similar bans into law. Arkansas and Alabama have bans that were temporarily blocked by federal judges. The push has included efforts in some states to restrict gender-affirming care for adults and proposed bans on drag shows that opponents have warned would also discriminate against transgender people. Herzig came to the state Capitol to testify against a bill attempting to reinstate Arkansas' ban on gender-affirming care for minors by making it easier to file malpractice lawsuits against providers. In her testimony, Herzig talked about working with transgender patients who are on hormone replacement therapy. "Bills like SB199 are designed to hinder, not help, Arkansans by creating barriers to evidence-driven health care they deserve under the guise of helping the young and innocent," she said, later saying a vote for the bill was "unpatriotic, and casts doubts on our own health and research institutions who have worked through health care fields to improve the lives of Americans." During follow-up questions, Republican Sen. Matt McKee asked Herzig if she is transgender. When she said yes, he asked: "Do you have a penis?" The question was met with jeers and audible gasps in the packed committee room. "That's horrible," Herzig responded, telling McKee that asking her such a question was inappropriate and noting she was testifying as a health care professional. "I had never been so publicly humiliated in my life," Herzig told The Associated Press in an interview days later. McKee did not respond to an email or phone call, but defended his question in a written statement. "As a father of 4 daughters, I will do everything in my power to protect my children and the children of Arkansas, especially from the woke mob who intend to push their agenda and beliefs down our throats and destroy our families," McKee's statement said. The idea of protecting children by withholding medical care is undermined by health experts, who have said minors with gender dysphoria who do not receive appropriate care face dramatically increased risk of suicide and serious depression. McKee's questions were similar in tone to those posed to Debi Jackson's teen Avery, who is transgender and nonbinary, when they testified before Missouri legislators last year about a proposal to ban trans girls and women from participating on sports teams matching their gender identity. During the hearing, a lawmaker asked Avery if they were "gonna go through the procedure." Since that exchange, Jackson said Avery hasn't wanted to testify again before the Legislature. "It's this same idea that in any of these discussions about trans people just being treated with basic dignity and respect, legislators want to reduce them to one body part," Jackson said. "They miss the entirety of the human being sitting in front of them having a conversation." Advocates say the rhetoric surrounding these proposed bans further exacerbates an already treacherous environment for transgender people, their families and medical providers. Children's hospitals around the country have faced an uptick of harassment and threats of violence for providing gender-confirming care. Though she said she's received an outcry of support since her testimony, Herzig said she and the pharmacy she owns have also gotten hateful emails and calls. People opposed to gender-affirming care for minors argue that children are too young to make decisions about their futures, sometimes comparing such treatments to child abuse. That's despite medical experts saying the care is safe when administered properly. Nearly every major medical group, including the American Medical Association, has opposed the bans on such care for minors. Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott last year ordered the state's child welfare agency to investigate reports of gender-affirming care for kids as abuse, but a judge has since blocked those investigations. Amber Briggle, the mother of a transgender teenager in Texas whose family was investigated after Abbott's order, said she gets frustrated when speaking before lawmakers in her state who she thinks already have made up their minds on the issue. But Briggle said she plans on returning to Texas' Capitol this year and that Herzig's encounter motivates her even more to show up and speak out. "They should not have to fight this alone," Briggle said of transgender people testifying in statehouses. "They should know they have loving, supporting allies in their corner." Herzig said she probably would not have testified had she known she was going to be asked about her genitalia. "I felt like I was pretty much prepared for any combative question," she said.

        They are as common a sight in the courtroom as judges, as vital to the administration of justice as lawyers, and a necessary component to the justice system as they paradoxically play an almost invisible role in the same legal proceedings of which they are arguably the most active participant. They are the court reporters -- guardians of the judicial record who are required to maintain a laser focus during legal proceedings in order to capture a verbatim transcript that becomes the official record of the court. Although modern court reporting makes much use of technology, it owes its existence to a Roman slave -- Marcus Tullius Tiro -- scribe to the Roman statesman and philosopher Cicero. It was Tiro who, sometime around 63 B.C., developed a system of notation symbols and abbreviations consisting of over 4,000 signs that is considered the forerunner to modern stenography. Just as the development of shorthand revolutionized dictation by enabling people to take notes more quickly using symbols, development of the stenotype machine in the late 1800s revolutionized stenography by boosting the speed at which stenographers could capture speech. Modern stenotype machines contain microprocessors and LCD screens where the shorthand abbreviations appear in English almost simultaneously as they are typed into the machine. Using phonetic spelling techniques, as the reporters type the words are displayed on a laptop computer in front of them and are also transmitted to a monitor on the judge's bench in real time, allowing the judge to read an instantaneous transcript of the proceeding. In the Eastern District of Arkansas, headquartered in the Richard Sheppard Arnold U.S. Courthouse in Little Rock, four court reporters provide the official court record that is generated by the district's six district judges and six magistrate judges. The four -- Karen Dellinger, Elaine Hinson, Valarie Flora and Stephen Franklin -- have a combined 123 years experience as certified court reporters. Commenting on the origins of court reporting, Flora said many people were unaware that the position of scribe "is the second oldest profession." "The oldest is farming," she said quickly, with a laugh. Flora, a member of the Arkansas Board of Certified Court Reporter Examiners, is a relative newcomer to the federal court, having been with the Eastern District of Arkansas since July 2021. She received her certification, however, in 1987 and has extensive experience in Arkansas state courts and doing freelance work. She is also a virtual fountain of trivia about the profession, noting that among notable scribes of the past are none other than Charles Dickens, who, according to the Poynter Institute, was considered the best parliamentary reporter in England when he was in his early 20s. Dickens later went on to publish 15 novels, including "Oliver Twist," "A Christmas Carol" and "A Tale of Two Cities," as well as five novellas and hundreds of short stories and nonfiction articles. Dellinger, the district's chief court reporter, was certified in 1996 and came to the Eastern District of Arkansas in 2008. Hinson, the longest-serving of the four, was certified as a court reporter 38 years ago in 1985 and has been with the federal court in Arkansas since 1996. Franklin, who came to the Eastern District of Arkansas at the end of 2020, had served as a court reporter in the Southern District of Florida since 2001. To become a federal court reporter requires at least four years' experience as a court reporter and a Registered Professional Reporter (RPR) certification from the National Court Reporters Association (NCRA). The RPR test consists of two components, Dellinger said, a 100-question written exam covering knowledge of federal rules, ethics, grammar and the law to name a few, and a skills test composed of a five-minute question and answer session that requires the applicant to meet or exceed 225 words per minute with a 95% accuracy rate. Dellinger said the next level is Registered Merit Reporter, which has a skills test requiring the applicant to meet or exceed 260 words per minute with a 95% accuracy rate. "That's hold on to your britches time," Dellinger said with a laugh. "It's so fast. It feels like you're barely hanging on." Dellinger, Hinson and Flora said the acknowledged champion in their field is Mark Kislingbury of Houston, Texas, who, at the NCRA summer convention on July 30, 2004, achieved a record of 360 words per minute with an accuracy rate of 97.23%, according to Guinness World Records. Almost 19 years later, Kislingbury's record still stands. Kislingbury is the founder of the Mark Kislingbury Academy of Court Reporting in Houston, which Flora said is considered one of the top schools for court reporting in the country. "He's a beast," Flora said. "He's like the super hero of court reporting," Dellinger said. "He's our Shaquille O'Neal," Hinson cut in. "Our Michael Jordan. He's a superstar." Training, they said, takes on average two to three years to complete and can cost as much as $25,000 a year or more. That's for those who complete the course. The attrition rate is staggering. "We've been told the dropout rate is about 90%," Hinson said, then quipped, "and they told us the divorce rate is about half that." All said the profession is not a good fit for anyone looking for a nine-to-five, Monday through Friday type of career. Court reporters are responsible for transcribing their work into verbatim transcripts within 90 days for the public record. But, early transcripts can be ordered on notice as short as the same day -- for a fee -- and often are by attorneys needing a daily trial record, which often requires working after hours, on weekends, or even on federal holidays if that's what it takes to get the transcripts out to those who need them. On top of that, in federal court, reporters purchase their own stenotype machines, computers, software and other items, which can add up to several thousands of dollars. In addition, Hinson said, to maintain certification court reporters must complete 30 units of continuing education credits each three-year period. "If you let that go you have to re-certify," she said. Regardless, however, all three said they love their profession and have never regretted their career path. Hinson said her first career inclination was to go to work with her sister in finance but that soon changed. "I took a semester at UALR and decided I needed to find a different route," Hinson said. "My aunt was a court reporter at the Air Force Academy and my best friend was going to court reporting school in Austin. I started looking into that and decided I needed to do English instead of numbers." Dellinger said she decided to give it a try out of curiosity. "I don't know," she said. "I thought I'd try it and we had a program at my school already, so. Then I started and it just clicked." "Career day at high school," said Flora. "One of the local training academies came to school, I read the brochure and thought yeah, I'll check into it. I started with 40 in my freshman class and I finished with six." Court reporting, they said, is definitely not for everybody. In addition to the hours, court reporters must spend hours at a time at their stenotype machines listening closely to catch and capture every word said as it is said. That process, they said, is demanding physically as well as mentally. "It is, it's physically exhausting," Flora said. "We have to switch out every two to three hours, especially during trials, because it is so intense." "If it does click, though, you'll love it," Dellinger said, with Hinson and Flora nodding in agreement. "You have to love the English language," Hinson said. "Words." "You have to be almost a complete nerd about it," Flora cut in. "Lose sleep over a comma."

         BELLA VISTA -- Although it is a volunteer-run nonprofit, the Encore Bookstore at the Bella Vista Public Library functions like most professional bookstores, according to Kathy Jeffery, the chair of the bookstore committee. The committee is part of the larger Friends of the Bella Vista Library, and all the funds raised by the store are donated to the library. The library began as a nonprofit but became part of the city of Bella Vista in 2014. While the city funds most of the day-to-day expenses of running the library, the Friends of the Bella Vista Library still funds some things that aren't covered by the budget, Jeffery said. For example, the group helps pay for the Summer Reading Program activities and sometimes will pay for multiple copies of a book needed for one of the book clubs. The group also made significant donations to the building funds for the library's recent addition as well as a parking lot addition. Jeffery said she works closely with the library staff on donations. Often the library itself receives large donations of books and the staff chooses which ones to add to their collection. Sometimes they replace books that show signs of wear with donated copies, and sometimes they may add a new book to the collection. The books that aren't needed and the old copies that have been replaced are sent on to the bookstore. Even if the bookstore receives a donation directly, Jeffery checks to make sure it's not needed by the library. The donated books can save money that can go toward other library needs, she explained. The prices at Encore are always very low, she said. "There's nothing over $5," she said. "Anything older than 2007 is 50 cents. That's even better than Dollar Tree." Collectors sometimes find valuable books for a fraction of what they would pay online. She remembers one woman who was collecting Better Homes and Gardens Cook Books that cost $10 online, but only 50 cents at Encore. Collectors can leave their name and contact information so staff can alert them if a specific book is donated. Some people come in to prepare for a vacation and pick up "armloads" of books to bring along, Jeffery said. Sometimes those books are donated back to the store after the vacation ends. But Encore sells more than books. During covid, the library had to stop loaning jigsaw puzzles because they could not be disinfected. The book store received the library's collection of puzzles which are now available for sale. Often the same puzzles are donated back to the shop. The store no longer deals with VHS movies, but DVDs are still popular with collectors and ordinary movie watchers Jeffery said. Sometimes, there are E-readers for sale at Encore, and there are often audio books on CDs in stock. "We have a little bit of something for everyone," Jeffery said. They even sell some greeting cards. People receive sets of greeting cards when they make a donation to certain nonprofits, Jeffery said. They donate that to the bookstore so other people can pick up a greeting card for 10 cents. Calendars are another category of donations being redonated and sold for a small amount. A local home-school family was able to buy a calendar for their children for 10 cents each, Jeffery said. The Encore Bookstore operates with very little overhead. One of its larger expenses is for Ziploc bags that are used to contain puzzle pieces. Jeffery said when they moved the puzzle collection, they discovered the shelf that had housed the boxed puzzles was covered with random pieces so the bags became necessary. They also use plastic bags for shoppers who buy large numbers of books, but those bags are donated after being used for grocery shopping. When the library opened its new addition after a long shutdown for covid in 2020, Encore Bookstore had a new location. Now the store is located just inside the front entrance to the library. That means the volunteers who man the book store can see library patrons coming and going. Occasionally, they help the staff answer questions. The Encore staff includes 14 volunteers who work about 16 hours a month, Jeffery said. Although they have a full schedule right now, she's always happy to have new volunteers. The store is open Monday through Thursday from 9 a.m.-5 p.m. On Friday, the hours are 10 a.m.-4 p.m.  Print Headline: Encore Bookstore helps Bella Vista library Copyright © 2023, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

         WASHINGTON -- Anxiety over the need for worker retention and stable leadership has prompted two members of Arkansas' congressional delegation to introduce legislation aimed at providing Veterans Affairs facilities with sufficient staff and management. The Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee advanced one of the measures -- the CAREERS Act -- earlier this month. The legislation would increase salaries for physicians and clinicians, as well as provide employees with resources such as expanded eligibility for reimbursing professional education costs. The Senate bill additionally includes language requiring the federal VA secretary to put together a plan for filling any vacant medical center director openings within 180 days. The provision -- titled the VACANT Act -- has companion legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives. U.S. Sen. John Boozman, R-Ark., introduced the CAREERS Act with Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont.; Boozman and Tester serve on the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, and Tester is the body's chairman. U.S. Rep. Steve Womack, R-Ark., introduced the VACANT Act in the House of Representatives. The CAREERS Act would raise the $400,000 pay cap for physicians and professionals such as optometrists and dentists to make salaries more competitive with private sector opportunities. The legislation would additionally cover licensing exam costs for future personnel involved in VA scholarship programs and expand eligibility for reimbursing staff for professional education. The legislation is a response to ongoing staffing shortages within VA facilities. The Department of Veterans Affairs' Office of Inspector General, in a study released last July, reported an increase in staff shortages across the country; each of the nation's 139 Veterans Health Administration facilities had at least one "severe occupational staffing shortage." "As I go around the country -- whether it's rural Arkansas or rural wherever -- it's simply difficult to get any sort of health care professionals, much less at the VA," Boozman, of Rogers, told committee members during a Feb. 16 meeting. John Donovan, the adjutant with the Disabled American Veterans Department of Arkansas, said the VA system has been dealing with staff shortages for years, but the coronavirus pandemic worsened the issue as professionals worked additional hours. "When covid hit, it just brought everybody down," he explained to the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. "A lot of people left, and that kind of hit everybody." Veterans can seek medical treatment from private practices and other facilities, but Donovan, a Navy veteran and Conway resident, said doctors at these facilities may not understand veterans' issues like VA staff. "For example, if I was to go in for a back issue, and I'm talking to the doctor and I make a statement about if this doesn't get fixed, I'll fix it myself, that would be key for a VA doctor to hear that and say, 'OK, let's have you talk to mental health as well while you're here,'" he said. "A normal civilian doctor may not get that. They may not get why that statement was made." Donovan continued: "The VA health care system is designed to not only work within your specialty, but it's to listen to things outside of your specialty. That's part of their training." Lawmakers made steps in the last Congress to improve the VA's workforce, including a VA Rural Recruitment and Hiring Plan in a law expanding treatment for veterans exposed to toxins via burn pits. "[Doctors] have the ability to make a lot more money than the VA can pay," Donovan acknowledged. "We want them to stay with us, so the best thing we can do is let's move their pay to where it's a comparative stature to their civilian counterparts and give them the additional training that is needed." Both Boozman and Womack tie the VACANT Act to leadership issues involving the Fayetteville VA Medical Center. The facility did not have a permanent director between May 2021 and early this year. Officials in January named Dr. George Velez as the next leader of the Veterans Health Care System of the Ozarks, which includes the Fayetteville medical center and seven outpatient facilities in Arkansas, Missouri and Oklahoma. "We went more than 18 months without a director," Boozman said during the Feb. 16 meeting. Donovan said having a permanent director provides stability to a facility, stating the director "sets the tone." "If there are any issues, the director needs to know about it and they need to stay in place long enough to be able to take care of it," he said. "Not all of our problems that we come across in a VA facility are something that can change overnight." In a statement to the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Womack, of Rogers, said keeping dependable VA leadership and staffing is essential in ensuring veterans have quality health care. "The VACANT Act is based on remedying persistent staffing challenges. We have a duty to ensure proper leadership is in place at medical centers delivering proper oversight and certifying veteran's needs are being met," he said. "This bill -- alongside other efforts -- is crucial to fulfilling our promise to the men and women who served in uniform." Womack met Velez during the House's recent two-week district work period. Senators will refine the legislation as the year continues. Tester has agreed to hold another hearing concerning requests from VA officials. During the Feb. 16 meeting, Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kansas, said he reached a deal with Tester and Boozman on "common-sense guardrails" related to pay increases in the CAREERS Act. Donovan and DAV officials will visit Washington, D.C. this week to speak to lawmakers about their legislative priorities for the current Congress. This outreach will include delivering a presentation to the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee on Tuesday.

         Grant Wallace, a former chief deputy state treasurer, has started work as the director of the state's Employee Benefits Division. Last week, Wallace took on his new role with a salary of $128,685 a year, said Alex Johnston, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Transformation and Shared Services. Wallace served as the state Department of Human Services' director of budget, forecast and financial analysis with a salary of $111,900 a year from Jan. 1 until Feb. 17, according to state officials. The Employee Benefits Division's former director, Jake Bleed, started work as legal counsel at the Arkansas Development Finance Authority on Jan. 16 with a salary of $140,591 a year. As the Employee Benefits Division director, Bleed's salary was $154,492 a year, according to Johnston. The division manages the group health and life insurance plans and other select benefits to build quality programs for eligible members while promoting customer service, education, accessibility and affordability, according to its website. The projected annual budgets for the state's public school and state employees' health insurance plans total $750 million, Johnston said. The state's public school and state employees health insurance plans cover about 183,000 people, including working members, retirees, spouses and dependents. Wallace was a chief deputy treasurer for the state treasurer's office from 2015 until this year. The state Board of Finance approved the nomination of Wallace to be the division's director during its Feb. 16 meeting. Department of Transformation and Shared Services Secretary Joseph Wood nominated Wallace for the post, citing his previous work with the state and federal government and the board. Wallace served as grassroots manager for the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network from 2013-2015, campaign manager for Republican congressional candidate Beth Anne Rankin in 2011 and 2012, regional director of health initiatives for the American Cancer Society in 2010 and 2011, and field director for the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network from 2008-2010, according to his resume. He served as assistant director of Gov. Mike Huckabee's Washington, D.C., office from 2003-2007. Huckabee is the father of Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who was sworn in as the state's chief executive on Jan. 10. On Thursday, John Bridges, executive director of the Arkansas State Employees Association, said he was "enthusiastic" about Wallace's appointment. The Arkansas State Employees Association met Thursday morning with Wallace and the leadership team at the state Department of Transformation and Shared Services "And we left very impressed with their fresh perspective and commitment to the employee health insurance plan," Bridges said. Wallace is taking over as director of the state's Employee Benefits Division after the agency began providing group Medicare Advantage with prescription drug coverage to retirees in the state's public school and state's health insurance plans who didn't opt out of the coverage. The retirees who didn't opt out of the Medicare Advantage coverage retained the previous coverage provided by the plans. As of Jan. 30, about 12,500 retirees in the state's public school and state employees' health insurance plans have opted out of group Medicare Advantage with prescription drug coverage for this year, choosing to retain their former coverage, according to the state Department of Transformation and Shared Services' figures. About 14,400 other retirees in these health insurance plans have been enrolled in the new group coverage as of Jan. 30, figures from the department show. Retirees who are 65 or older or who are otherwise eligible for Medicare were automatically enrolled in the group Medicare Advantage program for this year and were given the opportunity to opt out or to retain existing benefits in November. In mid-December, a few state lawmakers said they heard from retirees who said they turned in forms to opt out of the group Medicare Advantage coverage this year only to later be informed that they would be enrolled in it. The formal period for retirees to opt out of the Medicare Advantage coverage for this year was in November, but the state's employee Benefits Division accepted forms from retirees wanting to opt out through the end of January. Earlier this month, Johnston acknowledged that 1,102 retirees were initially assigned the wrong coverage before the problem was fixed. "We've encountered some challenges throughout the opt-out process due largely to the size of the retiree population and the novelty of the new MAPD offering," she said.

         After it was closed for reconstruction in April, the new Sixth Street bridge in Little Rock is set to partially reopen in March after contractor Kiewit Massman Construction met its schedule to demolish and reconstruct the bridge in 11 months. The Department of Transportation announced last week that, weather permitting, the bridge will open on March 5 as part of the next phase in the 30 Crossing project on Interstate 30. The new phase includes traffic pattern changes that will be in place through late 2024, when the bridge is expected to open to full traffic patterns. Pattern changes until then include closing the off-ramp to Ninth Street and opening the I-30 westbound off-ramp (Exit 140) to Sixth Street. Construction crews will close access to the Sixth Street bridge from the frontage roads, as well as Collins and Ferry streets. When taking the new Sixth Street off-ramp, I-30 westbound traffic can choose to continue onto the southbound frontage road or take the left turn across the Sixth Street bridge to access downtown Little Rock. The southbound frontage road will be closed between Fourth and Sixth streets. To access Sixth Street, southbound traffic can take River Market Avenue and Ferry Street. Northbound frontage road traffic can turn east on Sixth Street or continue northbound on the frontage road. Frontage roads and Sixth Street traffic will not have access to the Sixth Street Bridge. Work began on the bridge and other parts of the first phase of the 30 crossing project in September 2020. In addition to replacing the Arkansas River bridge, 30 Crossing includes improvements to a section of I-40 in North Little Rock. The overall 30 Crossing project -- designed to widen the I-30 corridor to 10 lanes between Interstate 530 in Little Rock and Interstate 40 in North Little Rock -- is targeted to be completed by July 2025.

         The University of Arkansas at Little Rock will add another endowed professorship courtesy of a $250,000 donation from Elizabeth Bowles in honor of her father, musician, educator and entrepreneur W.D. Bowles. "My father was passionate about education and passionate about helping people," Bowles, CEO of Little Rock-based Aristotle Unified Communications, said in a news release from UALR. "I thought that honoring him with this endowment would be fitting because he cared deeply about the power of music and was a gifted choir director. I wanted to honor his roots." Walter "Dixon" Bowles was the leader of the Dan Blocker Singers, a popular 1960s group that performed on "The Milton Berle Show" and "The Lucille Ball Show," according to Angie Faller, news director at UALR. The musicians grew disenchanted with Hollywood by the late '60s, however, and several members of the Dan Blocker Singers relocated to Big Piney, Ark., at the invitation of a local minister, where they opened a dinner theater and ran the minister's guest ranch. "As he was driving to a screen test in Hollywood one day, my father realized he didn't want a life in show business," Bowles said in the news release. "My father was being hailed as the next James Dean, but that's not the life he wanted." Bowles spent the rest of his life in Arkansas, where he went on to become a successful entrepreneur. In 1995, he co-founded the internet service provider his daughter now leads, according to Faller. Previously, he had founded The Group Inc., an intentional community that managed the Lodge at Mount Magazine in the early '70s and opened popular dinner theaters in Greers Ferry and Memphis in the late 1970s. "Throughout every iteration of my father's entrepreneurial journey, music always remained important to him, as it is to me," his daughter stated in the news release. "I was a member of the youth choir my father directed, and in law school, I performed with the school's a capella choir." The W.D. Bowles Endowed Professorship in Music -- the eighth endowed professorship at UALR -- in the School of Literary and Performing Arts will attract and recruit highly qualified individuals to the position of professor, supplement university support for outstanding faculty and provide the holder with the resources to make contributions in teaching, research and public service, according to Faller. It's only the latest significant gift to be part of UALR's Centennial Campaign, which celebrates the university's 100-year anniversary in 2027 and is the largest fundraising effort in university history. Endowed professorships like this one are a critical piece of the Centennial Campaign, Christian O'Neal, vice chancellor for university advancement, said last fall. "We've brought in 65 new endowments since the start of the silent phase, and those will only improve as the university grows older." As of Feb. 1, UALR has raised more than $167 million -- the goal is to raise $250 million by 2027 -- as part of the Centennial Campaign -- and 148 new endowments have been created, according to UALR. Under the leadership of Lorissa Mason, director of choral activities, UALR's choral program "has flourished," Stacy Pendergraft, co-director of the School of Literary and Performing Arts, said in the news release from UALR. Kris McAbee, co-director of the School of Literary and Performing Arts, said "I am so grateful for Ms. Bowles' recognition and support of the choral program at UA Little Rock." Bowles, who worked for five years at the law firm of Arnold & Porter in Washington, D.C., before moving back to Arkansas in 2000 to join Aristotle, has deep ties to UALR. She graduated summa cum laude in 1989 with a bachelor's degree in international studies, and she's an alumna of the Donaghey Scholars Honors Program, which provided her a full scholarship and the opportunity to study in Europe. After her father's death in 2010, she took over as chairperson of the board for Aristotle. "The Donaghey Scholars Program provided excellent preparation for a career in the legal profession," Bowles said in the news release. "The Socratic teaching methods, the debates with teachers and the small class sizes all prepared me for law school. I think UA Little Rock gave me exactly what I needed to be successful at Vanderbilt Law School, and in fact, I graduated first in my law school class." With this gift, Bowles hopes to provide other students with the same opportunities she had as a student at UALR. "I hope the donation helps the school attract a fantastic choral professor and that, as a result, other students get to have the type of experience at UA Little Rock that I did," Bowles said in the news release.

         BENTONVILLE -- A Rogers woman was sentenced to 12 years in prison Tuesday in connection with an incident where she attempted to flee from police. Melody George, 30, pleaded guilty Tuesday to battery, killing or injuring animals used by law enforcement, aggravated assault, two counts of criminal mischief, possession of a controlled substance, theft by receiving and resisting arrest. Bentonville police officers were called Feb. 17, 2020, to the Walmart Neighborhood Market at 906 S.W. Regional Airport Blvd., according to a probable cause affidavit. A caller reported two adults were in the back of a Pontiac Montana possibly doing drugs, according to the affidavit. Sayer Smith, a Bentonville police officer, approached the vehicle and knocked on one of the windows, according to the affidavit. A man opened the door and the officer saw a plastic bag in the man's right hand, according to the affidavit. George was in the car with the man, according to the affidavit. Smith asked to search the vehicle, but the two declined the request. Smith requested another officer come to the scene with his police dog, according to the affidavit. George jumped in the driver's seat, put the key in the ignition and attempted to shift the vehicle into drive, according to the affidavit. Smith grabbed the gear shift and ordered George to stop, the affidavit states. Michael Alexander, another Bentonville officer, arrived at the scene with police dog Bico, according to the affidavit. Alexander released his dog into the vehicle after George failed to comply with orders, according to the affidavit. George drove forward and hit a light pole in the parking lot, according to the affidavit. George put the vehicle in reverse and accelerated into the front bumper of Alexander's patrol vehicle, according to the affidavit. Smith saw the man attempting to flee and apprehended him, according to the affidavit. Benton County Circuit Judge Robin Green sentenced George to 12 years in the Arkansas Department of Corrections. Green previously sentenced George to 10 years for violating the terms of her probation. The sentences will be served consecutively.

         BELLA VISTA -- In 1990, Cooper Communities was celebrating the 25th anniversary of the opening of Bella Vista Village, and designated May 17 as History Day. As part of the celebration, the Bella Vista Historical Society, which operates the Historical Museum, offered two bus tours that day to historic sites around Bella Vista. Due to the great interest in the tours, the Historical Society sponsored two more tours on July 22 of that year. Tours continued to be offered occasionally for several years after that. In 2014, Xyta Lucas, now co-president of the Historical Society, began offering tours again as a fundraiser for the museum. Rather than incurring bus expenses, these tours were set up as a car caravan, with interested parties meeting at the museum to set up carpools and then spending the next several hours driving from one site to the next, spending several minutes at each site while tour guide Lucas talked about the relevant history of each. Lucas conducted these tours through the end of 2017, at which point she stopped due to taking on other responsibilities with the museum. In 2018, Dale Phillips, now also co-president of the Historical Society, signed up to be a docent at the museum and expressed interest in restarting the tours, which he did in the spring of 2019. Other volunteers helping with the tours include Maci Echols, Nancy Noyes and JB Portillo. Tours continue to be a popular event with both long-term and new residents to Bella Vista. The next tour is scheduled for March 25. Participants will meet at the museum at 8:45 a.m. The cost is $15 each, or two for $25. Reservations are required in advance, with payment due the morning of the tour. The tours fill up quickly, so early reservations are recommended. Phillips is accepting reservations now at 812-899-2049 or by email at dkp55@ymail.com.

         BELLA VISTA -- The Bella Vista Public Library was recently named a top 10 borrower and lender of the Mockingbird virtual catalog system. Mockingbird is a service of the Arkansas State Library that connects participating Arkansas libraries for inter-library loans of materials, according to Bella Vista Public Library Assistant Director Amanda Gibson. "Anyone can go onto it and search for what library has what they're looking for, and they come to us and fill out the paperwork for an inter-library loan," she said. The website address is arsl.agshareit.com. At this time, 52 libraries in the state are participating. Gibson said the service is fairly new, and the Bella Vista Public Library has only been participating since September. "The first running of it was in June, and because of summer reading, we didn't sign up the first time," she said. "It's pretty new. Right at the beginning of summer reading, that's our busiest time. But we joined the second one [in September]." Gibson said the most commonly sought-for items are large-print books that the Bella Vista Public Library formerly had but that were damaged or cannot be reordered. "It's helped us out, and it's helped the patrons out," she said. Regarding being named a top 10 borrower and lender, Gibson said, "I was very proud, especially since those statistics were from June when it first started, and we didn't even join in until the fall. I'm glad our patrons are using it. We try hard to get every item the public wants. We can't get all of it, and this really fills that need." She added, "Before Mockingbird we've been unable to share our items with other libraries. This is the first time in several years we've been able to share our collection with other libraries. This kind of makes me feel better about, not only are we using other libraries, but other libraries are using us as well. I just kind of feel if we're going to be asking that of other libraries we need to provide it. It's a little more balanced."

         COLCORD, Okla. -- The Miss Colcord Youth Pageant will return Saturday at the Colcord Community Center. This year's theme for the pageant will be Sugar and Spice, according to Barbara Gray, the pageant coordinator. Admission is $6 per person and attendees 3 years old and under are free, Gray said. Tickets will be available at the door, the day of the pageant, Gray said. The pageant will be open to girls only this year instead of both boys and girls due to a lack of participation of boys in the previous year's youth pageant, Gray said. Other changes include breaking the pageant into two sessions, Gray said. Session One will be for ages 0-5 and will begin at 1 p.m., Gray said. The second session will begin at 4 p.m. and will be open to ages 6-15, Gray said. The pageant is open to girls who live within a 40-mile radius of Colcord, Gray said. Prizes for this year's youth pageant will be medals and trophies as well as certificates. Monetary prizes will be available for the crowd pleaser and photogenic contest, Gray said. She also said monetary prizes will be available mainly in the second session. There will be multiple categories for each session, Gray said. The first session will compete in beauty, personality, party wear and crowd interaction, Gray said. Second session categories will include beauty, onstage personality, crowd interaction, evening wear and day wear, Gray said. Gray also took the time to remind people of the Miss Colcord Pageant which will be held in October. The Miss Colcord pageant will offer scholarships to different universities, Gray said. Last year, pageant winners earned scholarships from Northeastern State University, Northeastern Oklahoma A&M College and Rogers State University, Gray said. "The youth one is kind of a training thing for the girls to learn as they go," Gray said. "We just use it as a training situation and finance opportunity for the older pageant.
