        A suspect has been arrested in the shooting of a man in the 2400 block of Court Street, Jonesboro police said Wednesday morning. The Jonesboro Police Department posted on its Facebook page around 10:45 a.m. that a man had been shot and transported to a local hospital. The 23-year-old man is in stable condition as of Wednesday afternoon, said Sally Smith, a spokesperson for the Jonesboro police.  The department announced on Facebook around 11:20 a.m. that the suspect had been arrested on High Street.  Smith said Michael McCline, 20, was arrested as a suspect in the shooting.   Nettleton high school and junior high were placed on lockdown due to proximity to the incident, Smith said.  “Attention NPS Families, we are taking precautions due to an incident occurring off our school campuses this morning. There is no current threat, and lockdowns are in place at the High School, Junior High, and STEAM,” Nettleton Public Schools said on Facebook before 11 a.m.  “It was only because of the incidents proximity, there was no reason to believe that the suspect was going to head toward the schools,” Smith said.  Police said the lockdown for the schools was lifted around 11:20 a.m.

        Two people were found dead in a vehicle outside Jefferson Regional Medical Center, and a third body was discovered in a vehicle parked outside Popeyes on Olive Street. All were found Monday morning. Authorities say there is no known connection between the two incidents.  At about 3:37 a.m., a maroon Ford Fiesta parked in front of the emergency room entrance at Jefferson Regional was discovered with two deceased persons, one of whom was identified as Bobby Lane Carter, 63.  “Carters eyes were open, he had no pulse and was not breathing,” Pine Bluff Police Sgt. Sabrina Washington wrote in her narrative in the police report. Det. Chris Wieland said Pine Bluff police were notified at about 8:40 a.m. that the other deceased person was identified through a mobile fingerprint scanner from Arkansas State Police. The person is Sarah Bray, 62. She was lying in the backseat with her head toward the back passenger door and appeared to have a crack pipe behind her head, according to the original narrative from Washington. At about 9:11 a.m., another officer was sent to Popeyes at 2700 S. Olive and noticed a silver GMC Sierra bearing an Alaska license plate. A man identified as Bobby Swartz was “slumped to the side” without a pulse and not breathing when the officer discovered him. Fire and emergency services technicians broke the passenger side window to get to Swartz, as the doors were locked. According to the narrative, an officer spoke with a Popeyes worker who said her boss came in at about 6 a.m. and noticed the vehicle was already parked outside. The worker said she received a call later, from a night shift worker asking her to check on the person in the truck. The worker told police she knocked on the driver door and hood of the truck, and she called for a welfare check after noticing Williams was not moving or breathing. Jefferson County Coroner Chad Kelley pronounced Swartz dead at 10 a.m.

        Temperatures near freezing were found all over the state Wednesday morning, according to forecasters with the weather service in North Little Rock.  “We saw a widespread freeze until around 10 a.m. this morning,” said Colby Pope, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service.  He said the lowest temperature this morning was 18 degrees in Gentry, but over 20 records were broken or set with this chill.  “The Clinton airport in Little Rock reached 33 degrees; had we reached 32, we would have set the record for earliest freeze,” Pope said. “We were that close!” For Thursday, the state could see lows in the middle to upper 30s, Pope said.  “We will see highs in the lower 80s or upper 70s across the state for Thursday and Friday,” he said. “Its hard to believe.”  Pope said the next chance of rainfall and cooling down will be from Sunday to Monday, when another cold front moves into the state.  “Its difficult to say because it is so far out, but there is a small chance, for now, of some strong winds and maybe some storms,” he said.  The meteorologist said his main concern was a higher risk for dangerous fire conditions from Friday to Sunday, due to the warmer temperatures and the dry air.  “Winds could ramp up to 20 or even 30 miles per hour on Saturday night and really dry out the area,” Pope said, “The rain we got last Saturday may have put a slight dent in the drought but it is still really dry.”  The Arkansas Division of Agriculture map shows that, as of Wednesday afternoon, only 10 counties did not have a burn ban in place.  Another map from the division shows the wildfire danger. On Wednesday, most of the state was classified as a high or extreme risk.  “While some rainfall is in the forecast this weekend, this prolonged stretch of dry weather is having significant impacts not only on drought and fire weather, but on area rivers as well,” a tweet from the weather service said. The dryness is raising river concerns, according to the tweet, and the traffic on the Mississippi River is being affected.  The weather service also said on Twitter that the rainfall predicted over the weekend will have a minimal impact on this low water event.

         FAYETTEVILLE -- A Fayetteville man pleaded not guilty in Washington County Circuit Court on Wednesday in connection with the disappearance and presumed death of a woman. Kacey Jennings, 28, was arrested in connection with capital murder and abuse of a corpse after being released from a local medical facility, according the Fayetteville Police Department post on Facebook. The case is in connection with the disappearance of 28-year-old Allison Maria Castro. Jennings pleaded not guilty to capital murder, abuse of a corpse, tampering with physical evidence and theft of property. He was given a Jan. 17 court date before Circuit Judge Mark Lindsay. He is being held at the Washington County Jail. Capital murder, if convicted, is punishable by either life in prison without parole or the death penalty. Police searched an area of Beaver Lake for several days, but have yet to locate Castro or her body. Not having a body makes prosecuting a murder case harder, but it has been done successfully by prosecutors. Circumstantial and forensic evidence figure prominently in such convictions. Police went Sept. 19 to a residence and located Jennings, who was experiencing an apparent drug overdose, according to the post. Several documents were discovered at the scene indicating Jennings possibly killed Castro and disposed of her body, the post said. Castro's family members told police Jennings and Castro had been in a relationship and lived together, according to the post. She was entered as a missing person after a family member told police they were unable to contact her and were concerned for her safety, according to the post. Jennings got a temporary order of protection against Castro in mid-June, claiming she had physically attacked him and he was scared of her. Two days later, Jennings asked the order be dismissed.

        The fifth and final suspect in the fatal shooting of a Hot Springs man in 2020 was sentenced to seven years in prison Monday after pleading guilty in Garland County Circuit Court to his role in helping dispose of the victim's body. Donald Stone Ritchey, 22, of Hot Springs, pleaded guilty to abuse of a corpse, punishable by up to 10 years in prison, and was sentenced to seven years. He also pleaded guilty to tampering with physical evidence and was sentenced to the maximum of six years, with both sentences to run concurrently. "Obviously, no amount of prison time can change what happened, but I think the family understands that this was a good outcome based on the limitations we had, with 10 years being the maximum on a C felony," Garland County Deputy Prosecutor Brock Price told The Sentinel-Record Tuesday. Robert Krah, 18, pleaded guilty on Sept. 9, 2021, to manslaughter for the July 28, 2020, death of Christopher Lee Jennings, 20, of Hot Springs, and was sentenced to the maximum of 10 years in prison. He also pleaded guilty to tampering with physical evidence and abuse of a corpse and was sentenced to six years on each count, to run concurrently with the manslaughter sentence. Dakota Lee White, 20, of Hot Springs, pleaded guilty on March 28, to the same charges as Ritchey and was given the same sentence. A third felony count of theft by receiving of a firearm stemming from the gun used in the shooting being in White's possession was withdrawn as part of his plea agreement. Logan Chase Snyder, 20, of Hot Springs, pleaded guilty on Feb. 22 to the same charges and was sentenced to eight years for abuse of a corpse and six years for tampering with evidence, to run concurrently. John George Liapis, 19, pleaded guilty on Jan. 24 to the same charges as Ritchey, White, and Snyder and was sentenced to eight years in prison, but also pleaded guilty to aggravated assault and terroristic threatening for threatening a female witness at gunpoint and was sentenced to six years on each count, all to run concurrently. All five suspects were arrested on Aug. 26, 2020. Jennings was reportedly last seen on July 27, 2020, at the Mason Street home of Liapis, and was reported missing on Aug. 12 2020 by his mother, after she received text messages stating her son was dead, according to the probable cause affidavits. On Aug. 13, 2020, Liapis told Hot Springs police he had last seen Jennings on July 28, 2020 noting he had been at Liapis' residence but left that afternoon and he had not seen or heard from him since. On Aug. 14, 2020, police spoke to witnesses who said Jennings had been killed and buried in Oakland Cemetery in Atkins. Pope County sheriff's investigators and Arkansas State Police were notified and located a body "wrapped in plastic buried in a shallow grave," who was later identified as Jennings. Krah told police on July 28, 2020 he was at the Mason Street house "hanging out with friends," and Jennings was "playing around with a gun." He said he told him a few times to stop and finally Jennings handed the gun to him. Krah said as he took the gun it "went off" and struck Jennings. Snyder and Ritchey, who were interviewed on Aug. 15, 2020, both said they were "sitting on the couch" and Jennings and Krah were standing next to each other. Snyder said Krah was "playing with a gun" and Ritchey said Krah was "rapping" and "waving a gun around" when the shooting occurred. White told police he was at the residence in a backroom when he "heard a loud pop." He said he walked into the living room and saw Jennings bleeding from the head with a gunshot wound. He said everyone "freaked out" and wrapped Jennings in plastic. Then he, Snyder and Ritchey helped load Jennings into the back of his 2003 Ford Explorer and he and Liapis drove to Atkins where they buried him at the rear of Oakland Cemetery. White said he, Krah, Snyder and Ritchey returned two days later and moved Jennings further into the woods "into another hole they dug." He said the weapon, a .45-caliber handgun, was in the possession of his father, who turned it over to police. A computer check showed it had been reported stolen in Conway on March 22, 2020.

        Two people died in separate crashes on Arkansas highways Monday and Tuesday night, according to preliminary reports from Arkansas State Police. Candice Bogle, 65, of Morrilton, died when she was traveling north on Arkansas 113 in Perry County. While negotiating a left curve in her 2003 Acura TL, police said Bogle crossed the centerline and struck a 2002 Dodge Ram 2500 traveling south on the highway around 7:40 p.m. Monday. The impact of the crash caused both drivers to come to a final rest on different sides of the highway, the report said. In Lonoke County, 41-year-old Gillian Depriest of Mabelvale was traveling west on Arkansas 38 when her 2008 Mazda 3 crossed into the eastbound lane and struck a 2013 Ford F-150 head-on around 8:00 p.m. Tuesday, according to a separate report. Both vehicles came to a final rest in the eastbound lane. Officers said in both reports that the weather was clear and the roads were dry at the time of the crashes.

         The Senate Education Committee approved a plan Tuesday to increase annual teacher salaries by $4,000, a move that could be a blueprint for lawmakers in the next session in January. The recommendations from the committee are an end to a biennial process where lawmakers review the state public education system and make recommendations to the governor. Though this time lawmakers from the House and Senate education committees passed different plans, showing the two chambers are out of sync despite both being controlled by GOP supermajorities. In addition to an across-the-board $4,000 raise, both House and Senate proposals call for increasing the annual minimum starting salary from $36,000 to $40,000. But in contrast, the House proposal calls for the salary increases to begin in the fiscal year 2023, while the Senate plans recommended the state wait until the next fiscal year, which will begin July 1, 2023. "That's just kind of the nature of the lawmaking process," state Sen. Missy Irvin, R-Mountain View, said of the different proposals. "These are only recommendations; they could absolutely change in January." The proposals are part of statutory required recommendations that lawmakers make after reviewing a study put together by state education officials and outside consultants. Pay raises for teachers have become a top issue for many as school districts around the state struggle to retain and recruit educators. The Senate's plan also calls for adding an updated definition for college and career readiness, increasing the number of computer science and special education teachers, and creating a task force to study education funding. At the centerpiece of both the House and Senate proposals is the state's education funding formula, also known as the matrix. The matrix outlines a funding plan for a school district with 500 students, but local school officials have wide discretion in how they can spend state funding and have final say over salaries. "The superintendents and schools boards have to make those adjustments based on what their pay schedule looks like," Irvin said. Like the House proposal, the Senate plan calls for tweaking the education funding formula to spend more dollars on salaries, staff and benefits for school districts. There is also supplemental funding for school districts that can be earmarked for a specific purpose such as salaries. The Senate proposal calls for increasing funding for the average annual teacher salary from $57,208 to $61,208 and $62,530 in the fiscal year 2025. Both plans also call for raising a supplemental fund for teacher salaries from $52 million to $60 million. Since a report of a $1.6 billion budget surplus in June teachers and a bipartisan group of politicians have called for using some of those funds for teacher salaries. In August, Gov. Asa Hutchinson called a special session to accelerate a $500 million tax cut after news of the budget surplus. Hutchinson, along with Democrats and some Republicans, also called for using the budget surplus to increase teacher salaries but the effort failed during the special session. The plan also calls for merit pay increases, which would mean school districts could pay more for teachers who specialize in a needed subject such as physics or incentivize teachers to stay in the classroom rather than move into higher-paying administrative jobs. One of the few Democrats on the committee, Sen. Linda Chesterfield of Little Rock, criticized the plan for not matching salaries in neighboring states such as Mississippi. "We're talking about saying to our teachers, yeah, we want to be adequate," Chesterfield said. "There is nothing adequate about being paid less than your counterparts in surrounding states."

         The Super 1 Foods grocery store on East Harding Avenue in Pine Bluff is closing, according to a press release distributed Tuesday evening. “Due to serious staffing issues and the buildings lease expiring, Brookshire Grocery Co. (BGC) has announced the closing of the Super 1 Foods location at 1605 Harding Street in Pine Bluff,” the release stated. “The last day of operation for this Super 1 Foods location will be Tuesday, Nov. 1. All employee-partners will be transferred to neighboring BGC store locations in the same or elevated position.” Brad Brookshire, chairman and CEO for Brookshire Grocery Co., said the move was a difficult one to make. “We did not take this decision lightly but know its the right decision for our team,” Brookshire said. “Its better for our team to be concentrated in our other more profitable BGC stores in the Pine Bluff area. BGC has proudly served the Pine Bluff community for more than 25 years and we look forward to years of success ahead. We care about our neighbors and are committed to doing what we can to further support the Pine Bluff community. Our companys mission is to create and deliver exceptional experiences and value to our customers through our core values of excellent service, integrity and doing our best every day. Our employee-partners coming together at our other store locations will strengthen our service to Pine Bluff.” Employees from the closed location will go to work at one of the other three Super 1 Foods stores in Pine Bluff, the Brookshires store in White Hall or the Spring Market store in Redfield. Pharmacy prescriptions at the Harding Avenue location will be transferred to the Super 1 Foods on Hazel Street, the release stated. BGC is a regional family-owned grocery business that operates more than 200 stores in four states – Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas and Oklahoma – with three distribution centers. BGC operates five banners of stores, including Brookshires, Super 1 Foods, FRESH by Brookshires, Spring Market and Reasors. The company has more than 19,000 employees, according to the release.

        A second day of testimony Tuesday in a federal trial to decide the constitutionality of the state's first-in-the nation ban on health care for teens suffering from gender dysphoria included emotional testimony from the fathers of two of the teens at the center of the legal struggle between four families and the state of Arkansas. Act 626 of 2021 -- the Save Adolescents From Experimentation Act -- was passed in April 2021 after both the state House and Senate voted by large margins to override a veto by Gov. Asa Hutchinson. On July 21, 2021, a week before the new law was to take effect, U.S. District Judge James M. Moody Jr. issued a temporary injunction, barring the law from taking effect while the issue is being decided in court. In August, a three-judge panel with the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed Moody's ruling, prompting the Arkansas attorney general's office to request an en banc review by the full court. The law -- authored by Republican Rep. Robin Lundstrum of Elm Springs and passed on primarily party line votes -- would prohibit doctors from providing care to transgender teens suffering from gender dysphoria and would prohibit doctors from referring such patients to other providers. Among other provisions, the law would also bar the use of any state funds or insurance coverage for gender-affirming health care for transgender people under 18 and would allow private insurers to refuse coverage of gender-affirming care for people of any age. The ACLU has argued the law violates the constitutional rights of transgender teens, their parents and their health care providers. Donnie Saxton of Vilonia, a single father of five, testified to the change in his 17-year-old son Parker since he began gender affirmation therapy, going from depressed and withdrawn to an enthusiastic teenager brimming with confidence. Saxton spoke in glowing terms about the change in his son. "He's a cool kid," Saxton said. "He loves his choir, his friends, his art. He loves birthdays, so if you've got a birthday he's your man." Saxton said when Parker came out as transgender, he did so through a letter he wrote to his dad, "a pretty heartfelt letter explaining his situation." "It was a long letter but a good read and that was when he explained to me he didn't want to be referred to in the feminine and please acknowledge that," he said. "At that point a lot of things came clear, it explained a lot. It gave us a stepping off place." Aaron Jennen of Fayetteville said his daughter, 17-year-old Sabrina, came out to him and his wife, Lacey, the day after her 15th birthday. "A few weeks before her birthday she told us she had a surprise for us and to not look at our bank account," Jennen said. "It's not in Lacey's nature to not look at the bank account when someone tells us not to." What they discovered, he said, was that Sabrina had bought a Pride flag, which he said intrigued both of them. "We thought maybe she was going to come out to us as gay, we didn't know," he said. "The day after her birthday she just came to us and just said, 'Mom and Dad, I've got something I need to tell you. I'm trans." Jennen said Sabrina told them she had always felt like something was different about her. "At first, I was surprised," he said. "Sabrina never expressed any interest in playing with dolls or wearing feminine clothes or anything like that." Jennen said his first concern was whether Sabrina really knew what it meant to be transgender or if it was a phase she was going through, but his overriding concern, he said, was for her safety. "Society, especially this state we live in, there's not a lot of understanding around transgender identities," he said. "I was concerned about her coming into contact with people outside her circle of safety, what their reaction would be, especially her peers, whether she would be bullied, harassed, or worse." At the outset of the new school year, Jennen said, the family moved from Fort Smith to Fayetteville, and Sabrina started a new school with a new identity, and he said the family was embraced by their new community. Saxton, who has lived in Vilonia for 35 years, jointly owns a plumbing company his parents founded 31 years ago. He said his children attend school there and have active social lives. "Are you active in the community?" asked Beth Echols, one of the team of attorneys with the ACLU. "Holler if you need us," Saxton quipped, a ripple of laughter flowing through the courtroom. To have to leave Arkansas to seek care for Parker, he said, would be devastating. "This is home," he said. "We're from a small town and they've transitioned with us. They accept us. They've welcomed us in. We're not guaranteed that anywhere else." Jennen, an assistant U.S. attorney with Arkansas' eastern district, echoed a similar sentiment. He said Sabrina is thriving in school and the symptoms of her dysphoria have been largely alleviated by coming out socially and beginning hormone therapy. Both men were adamant that medical decisions for their children are collaborative efforts in concert with their children's health care providers and expressed no optimism about their long-term prospects should Act 626 take effect and those decisions become the state's to make. "Her not receiving treatment is not an option," Jennen said of Sabrina. "The state is essentially forcing us to make a very hard decision." Asked what might happen to Parker if gender affirming care should be withdrawn, Saxton responded, "I won't think about that. I just won't." Earlier Tuesday, Dr. Armand Antommaria, a pediatric hospitalist and bioethicist with Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, said the implementation of Act 626 would have the effect of placing physicians in Arkansas in a difficult ethical position. "Health care providers have an obligation to benefit their patients," Antommaria said. "The act puts health care providers in the untenable position of not potentially providing medically indicated treatment to patients that they believe would result in benefit to the patient, or violating the act and potentially losing their license and the ability to practice medicine and benefit other patients." Asked if treatments for gender dysphoria that are approved by the Endocrine Society and the World Professional Association for Transgender Health Standards of Care would be considered experimental, Antommaria was unequivocal. "No, it is not," he said, and noted that the risks associated with such treatment "are not categorically different than the risks associated with other treatments for other conditions." Dylan Jacobs, an attorney with the attorney general's office, addressed the hormonal therapy used in gender dysphoria treatment, which includes testosterone and estrogen, which are used in adolescents to bring about physical changes and to alleviate symptoms. "The medications used for treatment are all used off-label when they're prescribed for gender dysphoria, right?" he asked. "And they're able to be prescribed off-label because they've been approved for other indications in the past, right?" Jacobs asked Antommaria if those drugs would receive approval today for treating gender dysphoria, which drew a blank stare from the doctor. Even Moody appeared stumped at the line of questioning. "I think that's a very different world than the one we're living in," Antommaria replied. "Estrogen and testosterone have been utilized since the 50s." Antommaria said the very fact that the drugs are used off label today is because of the evidence amassed over years of study as the result of FDA approval. "The evidence we have wouldn't exist if these medications weren't approved for other indications," he said. "It's impossible to say what the FDA would or wouldn't have done." Dr. Jack Turban, a child development psychiatrist with the University of California at San Francisco, testified that studies on the long-term effects of transgender care for adolescents have indicated that mental health outcomes for adolescents suffering from gender dysphoria are improved over adolescents with gender dysphoria who did not receive gender-affirming treatment. Regarding the use of puberty blockers in pre-pubescent patients, he said there is no data to suggest that those patients suffered mental health declines as the result of the therapy. ACLU lawyers said they expect to call their final witnesses on Wednesday at which time the state will begin presenting its case.  Print Headline: 2 fathers testify in 2nd day of trial

        SPRINGDALE -- Justice of the Peace Lisa Ecke faces newcomer Michael Mapa in the race for the District 6 seat on the Washington County Quorum Court. The Quorum Court is the legislative body of county government and is composed of members called justices of the peace, who are elected to two-year terms. The 15-member Washington County Quorum Court has four Democrats and 11 Republicans. Mapa is a Democrat and Ecke a Republican. District 6 includes parts of southeast Springdale, east of Thompson Street and south of Robinson Avenue. Early voting will start Monday. Election Day is Nov. 8. Mapa said he's running as a continuation of the community service he began working with a local food pantry. He said he wants to provide a voice to the growing Marshallese community. "I'm a Marshallese, and there's never been a Marshallese running for the Quorum Court," he said. "With the number of Marshallese growing, I want to make sure all voices are heard in our local government." Ecke said she has fought for positive change on the Quorum Court, pointing to a new salary structure being considered and higher pay for employees. She wants to continue that work, she said. "I've been making hard decisions," Ecke said. "I've been on the Quorum Court since 2015, and my constituents tell me they want us to make the tough decisions, not to talk everything to death." The candidates have differing positions on one of the largest issues facing Washington County, a proposal to expand the county's jail. The Quorum Court in July approved an ordinance setting a Nov. 8 special election on a proposal to issue up to $113.5 million in bonds for a jail expansion and up to $28.5 million in bonds for a Juvenile Justice Center expansion project. The bonds would be paid by a 0.25% sales tax increase that would expire when the bonds are paid. Ecke said her view is the jail expansion is needed as a matter of public safety. She said allowing voters to make the decision is the right way to decide the question. "When I came on the Quorum Court they were discussing this," she said. "So the voters will be the ones to decide. I'm glad the decision will be theirs, and it will be final." Mapa said he opposes the sales tax increase, saying many people are still suffering from impact of the covid-19 pandemic and in District 6 residents are still recovering from a tornado that hit Springdale in March. "I think we should invest in the community, in health clinics, mental health clinics, work to create jobs to provide people with a livable wage," he said. Mapa said he wants to make county government more inclusive of everybody in the area. He said the county needs translators in government buildings to help people who speak Spanish or Marshallese as a first language. Ecke said she wants to see county government continue to value its employees and to improve the services it offers to a growing region. Each justice of the peace represents a district of roughly equal population. Redistricting for justice of the peace seats took place late last year. Washington County justices of the peace are paid $200 per Quorum Court and committee meeting they attend.

         Republican gubernatorial candidate Sarah Huckabee Sanders raised about $621,000 in contributions in September as her Democratic rival Chris Jones collected about $462,000 in contributions, according to their latest campaign finance reports. Along with Libertarian candidate Ricky Dale Harrington, Sanders and Jones are vying to succeed term-limited Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson in the Nov. 8 general election. Early voting starts Monday. Campaign finance reports for candidates for state offices were due in the secretary of state's office Monday. Sanders, of Little Rock, said Tuesday that Arkansans are ready for a bold leader who has the vision to take the state to the top by increasing access to quality education, reducing violent crime and lowering taxes. "We have incredible momentum and, thanks to the generous support of thousands who have invested in this campaign, I'm able to continue sharing my message of freedom and opportunity all the way through Election Day in every corner of the state," she said in a written statement. Jones spokesman Clint Schaff said Tuesday that Jones' fundraising numbers continue to rise month over month all the way through the general election, "and we are raising what we need to execute our plan. "We're running a campaign focused on Arkansas and on providing solutions to address the challenges facing Arkansans across the state," he said in a written statement. "While our campaign has steady advertising running on television, our path to victory takes us to front porches and front doors, churches and community parks, and football games and fish fries across Arkansas." In September, Sanders reported raising $621,485.63 in contributions and spending $1.7 million for the general election. Sanders' campaign expenses for the month included $1 million for television advertising. Last month's contributions and spending boosted the amount she has reported raising to $8 million and spending to $2.7 million for the general election, leaving a balance of $5.3 million at the end of September. After she raised and spent $13.1 million in the primary election, she transferred $4.2 million from her primary election campaign to her general election campaign. Sanders' campaign began what it has described as a $3.5 million paid media campaign with its first statewide general election television ad Sept. 3. Jones, of Little Rock, reported raising $462,651.59 in September and spending $351,894.97 for the general election. His campaign expenses for the month included $12,953 for television advertising. Last month's contributions and spending increased the total contributions Jones has reported receiving to $1.4 million and total expenses to $1.1 million for the general election, leaving a balance of $274,311.22 at the end of September. After he raised and spent $1.9 million in the primary election, he transferred $69,431 from the primary election campaign to the general election campaign. Through the end of July, Sanders' campaign had received about 57% of her total contributions from out-of-state donors listed by name and address in campaign contribution data, according to an analysis by the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. State rules don't require candidates to identify donors of less than $50. In contrast, Jones had received 46% of his contributions from identified out-of-state donors. The reasons behind Sanders' out-of-state money, political experts and donors say, include her national profile as White House press secretary for President Donald Trump, with her face and statements broadcast frequently in national news reports. She also profits from Trump's endorsement and the continued national presence of her father, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, who ran for president in 2008 and 2016. Harrington, of Pine Bluff, reported raising $1,395 and spending $2,216.92 in September for the general election, boosting the total raised to $33,961.72 and total expenses to $27,617.74, leaving a balance of $6,343.98 at the end of September. LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR In September Republican candidate Leslie Rutledge of Maumelle reported raising $43,087 and spending $25,834.30 for the general election.

She has served as attorney general since 2015. In September, Democratic candidate Kelly Krout of Lowell reported raising $30,747.85 and spending $15,882.80 for the general election. That increased the total amount raised in contributions to $242,199.73, loans to her campaign to $100 and total expenses to $193,951.23 for the primary and general elections, leaving a balance of $48,348.50 on Sept. 30 In September, Libertarian candidate Frank Gilbert of Little Rock reported raising no contributions and spending nothing for the general election. He reported the total contributions he has raised are $2,913.17 and his total expenses are $918.81, leaving a balance of $2,054.36 on Sept. 30.

        <font size="4.4" face="arial" color="black">
         CONWAY -- Republican Lt. Gov. nominee Leslie Rutledge said Tuesday that a bipartisan accountability group's ethics complaint alleging that she used her office as the state's attorney general to bolster claims over the 2020 election is "nothing more than a political attack" and "absolutely frivolous." About a month ago, the 65 Project filed complaints against Republican attorneys general in 15 states, contending they tried to overturn the 2020 election results. The group is called the 65 Project after the initial lawsuits that sought to overturn the results of the 2020 election. The group's complaint against Rutledge requests that the Office of Committee on Professional Conduct in Little Rock review her actions for lending the legal profession's credibility to amplify what they say are false assertions and frivolous claims. The complaint states that Rutledge joined with other attorneys general and submitted a brief in support of the Texas' bill of complaint in Texas vs. Pennsylvania before the U.S. Supreme Court and the filing was an example of political propaganda masquerading as analysis. During the Arkansas PBS debate among three candidates for lieutenant governor, Rutledge dismissed the complaint's charges. She said she has been very clear that she accepted Democrat Joe Biden was elected as president of the United States over Republican Donald Trump in the 2020 general election. Rutledge, of Maumelle, said she has filed more than 100 legal actions against Biden for what she called his illegal actions as president. Democratic Lt. Gov. nominee Kelly Krout, who is a licensed social worker from Lowell, said it is interesting that Rutledge is against frivolous political attacks. She said Rutledge has wasted taxpayer dollars by filing frivolous lawsuits against Biden, and that has not helped the state. Libertarian Lt. Gov. candidate Frank Gilbert of Little Rock, who is retired, said the ethics complaint filed by the 65 Project against Rutledge is a ruthless and unnecessary personal attack against her. Rutledge said she has filed legal actions against Biden for actions ranging from the cancellation of the Keystone Pipeline to the cancellation of $400 billion in student loan debt in order to protect Arkansans. Krout countered that Biden's cancellation of some student loan debt will put more money in the pockets of some Arkansans and help the average Arkansan. Rutledge, Krout and Gilbert are vying to succeed term-limited Republican Lt. Gov. Tim Griffin in the Nov. 8 general election. Griffin is running for attorney general in the general election. The lieutenant governor is considered to be a part-time elected post, with a state-paid salary of $46,704 a year. Under the Arkansas Constitution, the position's duties are to preside over the 35-member Senate with a tie-breaking vote and to serve as governor if the state's chief executive is impeached, removed from office, dies or is otherwise unable to discharge the office's duties. Rutledge said she has worked with the legislature on difficult issues over the past eight years as the state's attorney general, and she hopes to bring the same sort of civility in presiding over the state Senate and to make sure that all sides are heard. Americans and Arkansans are tired of the divisiveness in politics, she said, and "we need to be able to get things done." Gilbert lamented that politics in Arkansas is more divisive than it has ever been in his lifetime, with the "red tribe" and the "blue tribe" in opposing corners. Krout said she has the ability to communicate and to work with both sides, and she has Republican friends who are campaigning for her. Rutledge said "I don't know that we are going to be able to get the Senate to sing 'Kumbaya,'" but senators advocating their positions should be treated in a respectful manner by the lieutenant governor. Gilbert said the lieutenant governor has little to do, and the state Senate does not want an executive overlooking the chamber. The part-time post probably should not exist, he said. Gilbert said he has been a member of the Oath Keepers. The group's members are on trial for sedition and other charges linked to violence at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Gilbert distanced himself from the violence that transpired at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. He said he would not call the group a paramilitary organization. Gilbert said he joined the Oath Keepers about 10 years ago as a constable after he was approached by a law enforcement officer about joining the group, and he joined the group because it opposes unconstitutional orders. Law enforcement officers and the military should not follow unconstitutional orders, he said. Gilbert said he is no longer a member of the Oath Keepers because the group did not renew his membership. Krout said she was disappointed with the violence at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and the U.S. Capitol should not be attacked. Every election denier and person siding with President Trump paved the way to the violence that day at the U.S. Capitol, she said. Rutledge said the violence at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 was "absolutely unnecessary," and it is important that Americans "move past" that. She said she was nowhere near Washington, D.C., that day. She said it is important for state leaders to stand up to all violence. Krout said she opposes the proposed constitutional amendment that would require a 60% of voters rather than a majority of voters for voter approval of proposed constitutional amendments, because the minority would rule under the ballot proposal. The proposed constitutional amendment is Issue 2 on the general election ballot. Rutledge said it is important to read the four proposed constitutional amendments on the ballot. Arkansas' constitution has been amended more than 100 times, and it should be difficult to amend the constitution, she said. She said she does not want the Arkansas constitution to be changed "willy-nilly" with out-of-state money. She stopped short of taking a position on the proposed constitutional amendment. Gilbert noted that the legislature in each regular session every two years already is allowed to refer up to three constitutional amendments. He said he is qualified to be the state's lieutenant governor because he has served as mayor of Tull for eight years, Grant County coroner and Dekalb Township constable, and he served well in these positions. Krout said she would be an advocate for policies important to children and families as the lieutenant governor. Rutledge said she is prepared to step in as governor if called upon to do so, and she wants to be an economic ambassador for the state to increase its number of jobs and to work with Republican gubernatorial nominee Sarah Huckabee Sanders to ensure that the state eliminates the income tax. Sanders is competing against Democratic gubernatorial nominee Chris Jones and Libertarian candidate Ricky Dale Harrington Jr. to succeed term-limited Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson in the Nov. 8 general election.  Print Headline: Watchdog targets Rutledge

         Special exhibitions and artist commissions for next year's reopening of the recreated Arkansas Museum of Fine Arts in Little Rock were simultaneously announced Tuesday in Little Rock and at a live event in New York City where former President Bill Clinton participated. The museum's new 133,000-square-foot building -- to open April 22, 2023 -- will house its permanent and international collection of 14,000 works of art dating to the 14th century, according to the museum planners. The opening permanent collection installation will include the museum's drawings by Paul Victor Jules Signac, John Marin and Georgia O'Keeffe as well as paintings by Diego Rivera and Elaine de Kooning. The Drawn to Paper exhibition will showcase the museum's holdings of 20th century American and European works on paper. The reopened museum will also feature: Site-specific commissions by contemporary artists Anne Lindberg and Natasha Bowdoin. Work by Chakaia Booker. The New Media Gallery showing of the animated video "Tears of Chiwen" by Beijing-based artist Sun Xun. The banner inaugural exhibition entitled "Together" -- which explores in art the connections to each other and the natural world -- and will be made up of new acquisitions and loans by artists such as Elias Sime, Ryan RedCorn, LaToya Hobbs and Oliver Lee Jackson. "I'm thrilled that with this transformation," Clinton, the former president and Arkansas governor, said of the recreated museum. "Visitors from around the corner and around the globe will enjoy a world-class facility in the heart of Little Rock," he said in a news release. "This project is such a great model of public/private cooperation -- for small cities and big cities alike -- and I'm grateful to everyone who came together to make it possible." Clinton joined the museum's leadership team for Tuesday's New York City announcement at The Pool at the Seagram Building in Manhattan. Victoria Ramirez, the museum's executive director, called the artists and their works that have been selected for the first year "dynamic" and "representative of diverse artistic voices and practices." "With our permanent collection installation and exhibitions, our visitors will experience works that uniquely tell the story of AMFA, an institution that has brought the world of art to Arkansas for generations," Ramirez said. Harriet and Warren Stephens, who are the Arkansas Museum of Fine Arts Capital Campaign co-chairs, announced in recent weeks that the fundraising campaign supporting the reimagined museum project has topped $150 million -- exceeding the original $128 million goal. Harriet Stephens, also building committee chair, said in Tuesday's news release that the museum has since its beginning been "sustained by the passion of a dedicated community. "This project was a perfect opportunity to give Little Rock and Arkansas the world-class, 21st-century, sustainable arts destination it deserved for now and for the future," she said. Warren Stephens, the museum's foundation chair as well as co-chair of the capital campaign, highlighted the "outpouring of support for the institution." "Anyone who said we couldn't reach our ambitious campaign goals just doesn't know this community and our state," he said in the news release. "We've now raised an amazing $150.4 million -- a testament to the philanthropic spirit of the local community -- and the belief we all share in the future of Little Rock and this institution." Lead donors include Windgate Foundation, Harriet and Warren Stephens, the Winthrop Rockefeller Charitable Trust, Terri and Chuck Erwin, and the State of Arkansas. The capital fundraising campaign includes a $31,245,000 contribution from the City of Little Rock, generated through a hotel tax revenue bond approved by voters. "Our city can feel a real pride -- and a sense of ownership -- in an institution that connects our entire community, attracts visitors, gives downtown an economic boost, and will remain open to the public, free of charge, just as it's always been," said Little Rock Mayor Frank Scott Jr. The April opening of the redesigned museum will come after nearly three years of its being closed for rebuilding. The redesign unites existing structures with a signature pleated-roof central addition. The interior will include the the Harriet and Warren Stephens Galleries, Windgate Art School with the Robyn and John Horn Gallery, Governor Winthrop Rockefeller Lecture Hall, Terri and Chuck Erwin Collections Research Center, a performing arts theater, and a modern restaurant. The Studio Gang's architectural design also restores the historic 1937 art deco facade at the building's north entrance, and creates an entrance at the south that opens directly onto an 11-acre landscape, designed by award-winning landscape architect Kate Orff of SCAPE Landscape Architecture, that extends the museum experience into MacArthur Park. "Since its inception, the Arkansas Museum of Fine Arts has held community and arts education at its heart. But its facilities were holding the museum back from reaching its full potential," Jeanne Gang, Founding Partner of Studio Gang, said. "Our design strengthens the museum's role as a cultural anchor for Little Rock by uniting once-disparate structures into a cohesive whole and opening the building to the surrounding city and landscape," Gang also said.

         A man was arrested Tuesday in the fatal shooting of a man in Little Rock and a woman in Benton after bringing his daughter, who had also been shot, to a Little Rock hospital, police said. Demontra Hatfield, 39, of Benton faces a capital murder charge in the death of Larry Foster, 61, of Benton and a first-degree murder charge in the death of Krystle Wilder, 28, of Benton, police said. Little Rock police said in a news release they found Foster unresponsive after going to the 12800 block of the Interstate 30 frontage road in southwest Little Rock in response to a report at 8:24 p.m. Monday of a "subject down." Medical aid was rendered, but Foster was pronounced dead at the scene, police said. While officers were at the scene, they were alerted that Hatfield was at Baptist Health Medical Center-Little Rock with his daughter, who was suffering from an apparent gunshot wound, according to the release. The girl was treated for injuries that were not considered life-threatening, police said. They said detectives took Hatfield to the Police Department's Major Crimes Division for questioning. At about 1:30 a.m. Tuesday, police in Benton went to the Country Oaks Apartments after learning that a minor with a gunshot wound had been brought to a Little Rock hospital, the Benton Police Department said in a news release. Benton and Little Rock police determined Hatfield had fatally shot Wilder at their apartment during a disturbance and then fled the scene with the minor and Wilder's body, Benton police said. Benton police spokeswoman Krista Petty said in a text message to the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette that due to the investigation being ongoing, police could not say who shot Hatfield's daughter. Hatfield faces charges from Little Rock police of capital murder, first-degree domestic battery, unlawful discharge of a firearm from a vehicle, possession of a firearm by certain persons and endangering the welfare of a minor. From Benton police, he faces charges of first-degree murder, abuse of a corpse, possession of a firearm by certain persons, tampering with physical evidence and endangering the welfare of a minor. Hatfield was being held without bond in the Pulaski County jail on Tuesday evening. Information for this article was contributed by Grant Lancaster of the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette.

        Three people were killed and another injured in wrecks on Arkansas roads Sunday and Tuesday, according to preliminary fatality reports from the Arkansas State Police and other authorities. Gavin Glenn, 23, of Evansville, was killed Tuesday when his Ford F-250 left the roadway on North Wedington Blacktop Road in Lincoln, according to a report from the Washington County Sheriff's Office. The detective writing the report listed the time of the accident as unknown. Glenn's truck crashed into a ditch and began to roll, causing him to be partially ejected. Ray Moore, 74, of Fordyce, was killed just after 11:35 a.m. Tuesday when the GMC Terrain that Moore was driving left the roadway of U.S. 79 in rural Cleveland County, struck a culvert and came to rest in a ditch. Michael Henley, 66, of Austin, was traveling north on Willie Ray Drive in Cabot just after 10 p.m. Sunday when his 2002 Ford F-250 left the road, according to a report from Cabot police. According to police, Henley was killed after the vehicle went in a ditch and struck an embankment. A passenger, David Henley, 41, was injured in the wreck and taken to UAMS Medical Center in Little Rock for treatment. Authorities investigating each of the three crashes reported that the weather was clear and the road was dry at the time.  Print Headline: Washington County man among those killed in crashes

        BENTONVILLE -- Democracy requires that citizens participate, communicate and give others the benefit of the doubt, Dr. Condoleezza Rice said Tuesday evening at Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art. The 66th U.S. secretary of state was on hand for a conversation as part of the We the People: The Radical Notion of Democracy exhibition at Crystal Bridges, which combines historic documents and original art to provide diverse perspectives on the nation's founding principles. Rice said democracy is created and sustained through hard work, persistence, strong institutions and dedicated citizens. The nation has made progress over the last 250 years, she said, pointing to having been sworn in herself, a Black woman, by a Jewish Supreme Court justice. But sometimes the country still gets it wrong. "When we think abut the ups and downs, it's very easy to think about the downs," Rice said. "But we also have to think about the fact that progress is not linear; it's a bit choppy. But it's moved for the large part in the right direction and so I am optimistic about the future of American democracy, but I want to say one thing: It's not self-sustaining." Rice said she doubts that the founding fathers foresaw Facebook and other social media that have become so divisive. She offered several "rules" to consider, including that people should make a point of talking to those who have different opinions, get out of their own echo chambers and leave open the possibility they might being wrong. "If I could have a rule, it would be that no one in a position of authority gets to tweet or post anything until they have talked to somebody else and heard their opinion," Rice said. "If before you have bothered to talk to someone you might have to compromise with, you've already gone to rev up your base, you're not likely to compromise." Political campaigns have become less about what a candidate wants to do if elected and more about what they want to stop the other side from doing, Rice said. "That's the death of democracy if in fact you can't somehow find some way to move together toward solutions," Rice said. "Somehow we have to learn to talk across our differences." Democracy is about the Constitution and the nation's institutions, but civil engagement is important, Rice said. She urged people to decide what issues are important, then work on those things. "I'll bet 300 million of us doing that, we might actually make progress and not just leave it to the government to do," Rice said. "How about you go and get yourself on a local planning commission or a local school board. Democracy is at every level." Rice said local issues give people a sense of control over their lives. One reason that people lose interest in politics and democracy is that they don't think they can do anything to make a difference. "We've got to break that down," Rice said. Democracy and freedom rely on each other but are not the same, Rice said. "What the founders understood was that giving freedom is a wonderful thing, but unless you channel it in some way, it can simply be the will of the mob," Rice said. To that end, the founders were very determined to have representative government and protections like the Electoral College so everyone would have a say, Rice said. "It's a very carefully designed system, and when I hear people wanting to pick pieces of it apart, I say be careful what you wish for because they really did think through this issue, that you don't want the tyranny of the majority," Rice said. Rice said political candidates should not be vessels for discontent and spend their time yelling on television about how bad the other side is. "I frankly don't love the cults of personality that we see forming in the country. I don't really love celebrity politics terribly much," Rice said. "Polarization isn't the problem; we've always had people who are difficult. Demonization is the problem." Rice said the nation can't have the conversations needed to fix problems if someone immediately goes to the most extreme language about it. "If everyone who disagrees with you is morally corrupt, they are anti-democratic -- that language, that posture is really not healthy for democracy," Rice said. "And I think we have to be more demanding of our leaders, that they don't engage in that, and we certainly shouldn't reward it." Instead, Rice said we should make an individual effort to reach out and try to understand those we disagree with. "Each and every person commit to reading something or talking to someone with whom you disagree," Rice suggested. "And, not talking so that you can, in the first order, persuade them but so you can actually hear them and that you might actually then understand where they're coming from. You might still disagree at the end of the day, but at least you'll have a better system established with that person, that you can have a civil conversation." Rice said talking to people you disagree with is not some form of capitulation. "It doesn't mean that you compromise on your principles but again it goes to the extreme language. If everything is a matter of principle, then we have nowhere to go. Sometimes it's just a different interpretation principle, and we call that a policy difference," Rice said. "And if we could learn to know the difference in a policy difference and a matter of principle, we might be a better democracy."  Visit We the People: The Radical Notion of Democracy is on view from July 2 to Jan. 2 in the museums collection galleries at Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art. Admission to this exhibition is free; however, due to its anticipated popularity, timed-ticket reservations are required. Tickets are available on the museums website. Admission to Crystal Bridges collection galleries is always free. Source: Crystal Bridges     Print Headline: Rice says democratic participation needed

        BENTONVILLE -- A current School Board member hopes to retain her seat but faces a challenge from a political newcomer. Jennifer Faddis was elected to the board in 2020, when she defeated Jim Parsons of Bella Vista. Her opponent this time is another Bella Vista resident, Gail Pianalto. The Bentonville School Board has seven members. Until this year, each member represented a specific zone of the School District; the board agreed to restructure itself so five positions are based on geographic zones and two are at-large. Residents therefore get to vote for their zone representative and for both of the at-large members when those seats come up for election. Each of the five zoned seats are up for election this year. Once the board is seated after the November elections, members will draw a term length ranging from one to five years so their terms will be staggered. Board members normally serve five-year terms. Zone 2 covers Bella Vista west of Bella Vista Way and stretches south to Vaughn Road in southwest Bentonville, incorporating north and west Centerton as well. School board positions are nonpartisan and unpaid in Arkansas. GAIL PIANALTO The board over the last few years has faithfully served the wishes of the superintendent and administration but has failed to "authentically and transparently" represent their constituents, Pianalto said. "They have disregarded the concerns of parents and their right to make educational and health-related decisions for their children," Pianalto said. The board has approved the spending of millions of dollars while asking very few questions regarding those expenditures, she said. She said she's running because she cares about children and wants them to have the tools to overcome whatever educational challenges they face. She served for five years as a volunteer court-appointed special advocate in Benton County, advocating for young children in the foster care system. "I have the skills, experience, education and time to be a resource and advocate for parents in the Bentonville School District, many of whom are dedicated teachers and are also busy raising their own families," she said. If elected, she said she would advocate for a focus on foundational basics, with a goal of raising standardized test scores; would facilitate communication in educational decisions between district leaders, parents and stakeholders; would address key factors in staff job satisfaction that will lead to hiring and retaining excellent teachers; and would support fair and sensible spending. JENNIFER FADDIS Faddis said she's running for reelection primarily because she has children in the district and wants the best for them and all kids in the district. "I know that God has called me to serve in my community, and, because of that calling, I will fight against anything or anyone that might harm our students," Faddis said. She also wants to keep politics out of the board. "The School Board should never be about a national political agenda," she said. Faddis would like to expand the district's Ignite program, which allows high school students extensive time to explore a particular career area. Increasing teacher pay and improving parental involvement are two of her other main goals, she said. Growth is the district's biggest challenge, she said, adding she's proud of administrators for compiling a 10-year plan -- available on the district's website -- that keeps growth at the forefront of board members' minds. Faddis said she is also proud to be part of a united board. "We haven't always agreed on everything, but we have worked together with the same common goal to ensure that our students receive the highest quality education that they deserve. I am also proud that we have voted the past two years to give teacher bonuses, and that we are continuing to work toward compensating our teachers like they deserve."

        BENTONVILLE -- A Rogers man was sentenced Monday to 15 years in prison for raping a girl. Paul Scott Minarik, 50, pleaded guilty to two counts of rape, hindering apprehension or prosecution and possession of firearms by certain persons. A 18-year-old woman reported to Rogers police in June 2021 Minarik sexually abused her 40 to 50 times when she was 16 years old, according to a probable cause affidavit. The woman read a victim impact statement in court in which she told Minarik, who stood a short distance from her, that she finally saw through the manipulation and grooming. "The pain was numbed to an extent in the moment by lies and forced secrecy, but came crashing like a boulder the moment I finally was able to speak to anyone about it, and I've been trying to recover from that avalanche still to today," she said. "Now, the moments I don't feel pain or cry are the ones where I'm either too distracted by life and work or ones I can push back far enough in my brain to almost forget." The hindering charge relates to another case. Minarik was accused of harboring or concealing another person who was wanted by police in a rape case. The firearm charge relates to Minarik possessing a Bersa .380 firearm after being convicted in 2008 of felony theft of property, according to court documents. Benton County Circuit Judge Robin Green sentenced Minarik to 15 years in the Arkansas Department of Corrections.  Print Headline: Rogers man sentenced to 15 years in prison for raping girl

        ROGERS -- The developers of an organic grocery store, shopping center and apartment space near the corner of Promenade Boulevard and New Hope Road got conceptual approval from the Planning Commission on Tuesday night. Commissioners unanimously approved a rezoning of an 8.67-acre empty lot off Promenade Boulevard, east of Home Depot and between Seminole Drive and Seneca Road. Mark Myers, Jorge Andrade and Derek Burnett were absent. The request will move to the City Council for consideration. The rezoning would change the property from the highway commercial zoning district to the uptown commercial mixed use zoning district. Atlanta, Ga.-based firm SJC Ventures is planning the development. SJC's only project in Arkansas so far has been the Whole Foods Market in Fayetteville, according to its website. Earlier this year, the city approved a separate rezoning for the development for 12.25 acres at 1750 and 1800 S. Osage Springs Drive, northwest of the intersection of Promenade and New Hope. In a Tuesday email to the Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, a representative of SJC Ventures said the mixed-use development will be centered around an organic grocery store. The project's estimated opening is in late 2024, according to the representative. The grocery-anchored shopping center will include 350 apartments and 80,498 square feet of retail space -- a 37,009-square-foot grocery store and four shop buildings totaling 43,489 square feet -- according to plans by SJC Ventures. The representative declined to comment on the specific plans for the property east of Home Depot. Before any construction begins on the project, a large-scale development plan will have to be approved by the city. SJC Ventures has developed more than 60 retail, mixed-use, multifamily and office projects across 10 states. Many of the firm's current and active projects include Whole Foods Markets and a few have included Target and Wegmans, according to its website. The only Whole Foods stores in the state are in Fayetteville and Little Rock, according to the company's website.  None  Other action The Rogers Planning Commission also: Approved unanimously the rezoning of 0.32 acres at 318 N. C St., north of Walnut Street and east of Arkansas Street, from the residential duplex and patio home zoning district to the neighborhood transition zoning district. Approved the rezoning of 15.6 acres east of North Eighth Street and south of West Hudson Road from the highway commercial and residential duplex patio home zoning districts to the light industrial zoning district, which allows industrial operations and activities as well as the storage and transfer of goods. Steve Lane abstained. Approved unanimously plans to build four storage buildings, totaling 25,287 square feet, as additions to an existing warehouse facility at 2836 S. Eighth St. Approved unanimously a preliminary plat for a proposed 57-lot subdivision, called Meadow Brooke Phase II, on 19.24 acres southwest of the intersection of South Chanberry Lane and South Bellview Road.

        BENTONVILLE -- A Berryville man was arrested Friday in connection with internet stalking of a child. William Brock, 34, was on a social media site communicating with who he thought was a 14-year-old girl but was actually an undercover Siloam Springs police detective, according to a probable cause affidavit. Prosecutors have not filed any formal charges against Brock, who was being held Tuesday in the Benton County Jail with a $100,000 bond set. The detective was pretending to be a 14-year-old girl when he encountered Brock on the social media site, according to the affidavit. Brock told the girl he would invite her to his home or pick her up, but he had a feeling Chris Hansen may be involved, according to the affidavit. Hansen was a reporter for NBC and hosted "To Catch a Predator," where he confronted people who traveled to meet in person a child they had met online. The undercover officer asked Brock about Hansen, according to court documents. Brock told her Hansen is the "To Catch a Predator" guy, and she's probably too young to remember the show. Brock continued to communicate with the detective and told who he thought was a teenager he would pick her up if his car wasn't broken down, the affidavit states. Brock sent sexually explicit messages and is also accused of sending two sexually explicit photographs of himself to the undercover officer, according to the affidavit. Brock sent his address to the officer in hopes of her coming to his home, according to the affidavit. His arraignment is scheduled for Nov. 21 in Benton County Circuit Judge Robin Green's court.

        EUREKA SPRINGS -- A candidate for mayor in this tourist town can't legally run for the office because he pled guilty to a felony in 2003, a judge ruled Tuesday in Carroll County Circuit Court. It's too late to remove Beau Zar Satori's name from the Nov. 8 election ballot, but votes for him won't count, said Circuit Judge Scott Jackson. Almost 20 years ago, Satori pled guilty to one count of failure to file a sales-tax form to the state. Satori said the case was sealed and to be expunged from his record after he completed probation. But in 2019, the Arkansas Legislature changed the law, and expungement no longer allowed a person to run for elected office, said Jackson, citing Arkansas Code Annotated 21-8-305. "Because of this 2003 court proceeding, Mr. Satori, you cannot run or hold the office of mayor of the city of Eureka Springs, according to that statute," the judge said. "That's what the court's finding must be. Votes for Mr. Satori cannot be counted ..." "Of course, I'm not happy with the ruling, and I think that I tested the law," Satori said after court. "They can make up anything they want down there in Little Rock and put it out there until it gets tested. I'll be visiting with all my lawyers. We'll conference call on it and see what our options are, and we'll make a decision." Satori said Curtis Hogue of Fayetteville is his attorney, but he was at the Grand Canyon on Tuesday so Satori was represented in court by Brian Hogue, Curtis' son. Brian Hogue argued in court on Tuesday that Satori's plea didn't amount to a conviction under Arkansas Code Annotated 16-90-1404(2)(b)(vi). That statute states that a conviction doesn't include "The entry of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere without the court's making a finding of guilt or entering a judgment of guilt with the consent of the defendant or the resultant dismissal and discharge of the defendant as prescribed by § 16-93-301 et seq." "Judge, in this case, there has not been a conviction of my client," said Hogue. He said that when Satori successfully completed his probation, the charge against him was dismissed. Deputy Prosecuting Attorney Craig Parker said the title of Arkansas Code Annotated 21-8-305 is "Person convicted of public trust crime ineligible as candidate for office or to hold office," but that statute also includes people who plead guilty. Section (a) reads: "If a person has pleaded guilty or nolo contendere to or has been found guilty of a public trust crime, he or she shall not" file, run as a candidate for or hold public office. Craig Parker also cited 16-93-303(d), which reads: "After successful completion of probation placed on the defendant under this section, a defendant is considered as not having a felony conviction except for: (1) A determination of habitual offender status; (2) A determination of criminal history; (3) A determination of criminal history scores; (4) Sentencing; and (5) A purpose of impeachment as a witness under Rule 609 of the Arkansas Rules of Evidence." "In this case, all that is required to trigger 21-8-305 is that the defendant had pleaded guilty or nolo contendere, and I would contend that the state has proven that that has occurred," said Craig Parker. The judge had initially set the court hearing for Oct. 11, but Satori appeared without an attorney that day, so after some discussion, the case was continued until Tuesday. In court on Oct. 11, Satori said he decided to plead guilty in 2003 to one count in lieu of 86 more late payment charges being filed against him -- all for missing tax payment deadlines. "I agreed to sign a plea agreement for one felony in the event that it would be expunged and cleared," Satori told Jackson in court on Oct. 11. Satori -- an artist, gallery operator and former mayor -- didn't run for re-election in 2002 because of the charges pending against him, according to articles at the time in the Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. He served as mayor of Eureka Springs from 1999 to 2003. Tim Parker, another attorney, filed a motion to intervene in the case on behalf of Benjamin Sharum, saying if Satori isn't allowed to run his name should be removed from the Nov. 8 election ballot. "I have not been asked to rule on that," Judge Jackson said when Tim Parker asked about his motion. "That will be according to the rules of the Secretary of State." Jackson advised Carroll County Clerk Connie Doss to contact the Secretary of State's office "to see what other remedial measures should be taken because the ballots have already been printed." Other candidates for mayor include the incumbent, Robert "Butch" Berry, Brandon Cox and Tracy Johnson.  Print Headline: Judge: Satori cant seek office

        FAYETTEVILLE -- Some City Council members on Tuesday expressed general support for building a hotel at the southern end of the civic plaza of the downtown arts corridor but had questions on details, specifically parking. The council voted 8-0 to hold a decision outlining an agreement with a private developer to build the hotel until its Nov. 1 meeting. The agreement is a letter of intent between the city and Brian Reindl and his Reindl Properties company to create a seven-story, 134-room hotel in association with the downtown arts corridor, known as the Ramble. The hotel would sit at the southern end of where the parking lot west of the Walton Arts Center is now. The parking lot eventually will become the civic plaza of the arts corridor. A new parking deck is under construction northwest of Dickson Street to replace the 290 spaces at the Walton Arts Center lot. The council got a presentation from Rob Sharp, architect behind the hotel project. The ground floor would have retail, restaurant and cafe spaces, with public restrooms and storage available for an outdoor stage immediately north. The hotel lobby would have opportunities for public art. A rooftop bar would overlook the plaza. Estimated cost of the project is $50 million. "Brian's the kind of developer you want developing the ground floor of your hotel," Sharp said. "Instead of bringing in a Chili's, he'll bring in something local." Sharp spoke of the importance of having eyes overlooking the plaza for the safety of people below. The idea behind the project is to provide vibrancy and activity to the area, as opposed to the inactivity of a parking lot, he said. The project would have 32 to 45 basement-level parking spaces, but parking for guests primarily would be handled through a valet system, Sharp said. He estimated the hotel would need about 66 parking spots for guests and another 62 for patrons at the restaurant, cafe and bar spaces. Employees would be required to park off-site. Council members asked for a map showing the proposed locations downtown to put cars with the valet service. Fourteen members of the public spoke to the council about the proposed project. Commentary was split fairly evenly between support and opposition, with several residents expressing concerns over parking. Jerry Davis, general manager of 21st Amendment, Rogers Rec, Los Lobos and West End, said he supported the project and asked whether the developers could double the amount of parking on the basement level. Justin Tennant, a former member of the City Council who now serves on the Walton Arts Center council, said he wasn't against the idea of a hotel but the parking plan needs to be well thought-out. Several council members expressed support in general for the proposal but said they wanted more information. In addition to a parking map, they asked for more information about the building footprint, how shadows would cast over the plaza and the arrangement to have the land value appraised, among other issues. City Attorney Kit Williams emphasized points he made in a memo to the council that even though the agreement is a letter of intent, the council's decision will set the major parameters of the project. The city's hired real-estate attorney, Vicki Bronson, said the agreement was designed to bind the developer to certain terms and the council could still propose changes. Reindl spoke to the council and said he believed the city and his team could work out the issues raised at the meeting. "We tried our best with the LOI to nail everything down so there's not a bait-and-switch and say 'this is what we're going to build,'" Reindl said. "If we do what we say we're going to do, we'd like for that to be binding before we go out spending millions of dollars."  None  Council action Fayettevilles City Council met Tuesday and approved: Aligning city code with state law regarding the rights of bicyclists on sidewalks. Rezoning 2.43 acres at 6074 W. Wedington Drive from an agricultural use to residential single-family up to 4 units an acre. Rezoning 0.12 acres at 170 E. Mountain St. for downtown general uses.

        Gov. Asa Hutchinson and 18 other governors have submitted a letter dated Monday to the Biden administration to spell out their opposition to a proposed federal rule giving a preference to union construction contracts, Hutchinson said Monday. Earlier this year, Biden signed an executive order that requires Project Labor Agreements for federal construction projects. This action will require federal construction contracts of $35 million or more to have a government-mandated project labor agreement. A project labor agreement is a collective bargaining agreement with labor unions to establish the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project, Hutchinson's office said in a news release. "Labor unions have played an important role in our nation's history, but the government's role in business is to provide an avenue for success and not a roadblock." Hutchinson said in the news release. "I'm honored to have the support of 18 fellow governors from all corners of our nation as we seek to oppose this rule and support fairness for our states." The other governors who signed the letter are the chief executives in Alabama, Arizona, Georgia, Iowa, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Wyoming. Hutchinson has served as Arkansas' governor since 2015. He has said he is weighing a possible run for the Republican nomination for president in 2024.

         Secretary of State John Thurston and Anna Beth Gorman debated the state's low voter turnout, cyber security and how to improve constituent services Tuesday as part of a series of debates hosted by Arkansas PBS in Conway. The debate was the first and only scheduled forum for the two candidates vying for secretary of state, a constitutional office that oversees elections, state records, the Capitol and documents for businesses. Thurston, a Republican from East End, is running for another four-year term. Gorman, a Democrat and a nonprofit executive from North Little Rock, blamed Thurston for not improving the state's low voter participation rate, saying she would become an advocate for voter registration targeting overlooked communities. According to a federal report on the 2020 election, Arkansas ranked last in the nation in voter turnout and registration. "If you are going to be judging the performance of this job, the first thing you should judge it by is how many people are participating in our elections," Gorman said. Thurston pushed back, saying as secretary of state "there is very little room for advocacy." "If you are going to do an outreach or a voter drive or try to get more people to participate, which group do you pick?" Thurston said. "And that's why it's a very fine line for the chief election officer to go to any particular group and encourage them to vote." Countering conspiracy theories about the previous election, Gorman said the 2020 election was a "free, fair and sound election." Thurston said he was not sure about the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election, saying he could not vouch for other states' election regimes. "The short answer is, I positively 100% can tell you with certainty that I don't know," Thurston in response to a question about the legitimacy of the 2020 election. He added the last election in Arkansas was among the nation's "safest and most secure." Gorman said if elected she would push for Arkansas to allow voters to register online. Arkansas is one of 11 states that do not have an option for residents to register to vote online, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. "This is low-hanging fruit to overnight change voter participation," Gorman said. "And again, we live in a society where we do everything on our phone; why aren't we providing this access to Arkansans right now?" Thurston said he was "not in opposition" to online voter registration but said the issue is up to the General Assembly. "It is completely a legislative issue, completely," Thurston said. "If done correctly, yes, I think it would be convenient and a good thing." Debate moderator Steve Barnes of Arkansas PBS described Gorman's view of the office as one where she would "use the bully pulpit" if elected, while Thurston saw it as more of a "bookkeeping" role. Thurston said there are "times to speak out," giving the example of speaking against a lawsuit on the state's election system during the covid-19 pandemic, pushing back against calls for voter drop boxes. "There are times you do speak up," Thurston said. "You don't just sit there behind the desk and make sure the grass is mowed and the light bulbs are changed." Gorman said most Arkansans do not know who the secretary of state is and promised to make the role more high-profile. Later in the debate, Thurston responded by saying "maybe there is a reason no one has heard of the secretary of state in Arkansas -- because I've done a good job." "There's a reason I haven't been in the headlines, at least not very many times," he said. Thurston, who is finishing his first term as secretary of state, said voters should trust his experience in government, also having previously served as the commissioner of state lands. Gorman is executive director of the Women's Foundation of Arkansas and said her experience leading a nonprofit has prepared her for secretary of state. When Brandon Evans of television station 40/29 News in Fort Smith asked the candidates what area of the secretary of state's office needs the most improvement, Thurston said security of the Capitol building. The secretary of state is responsible for the Capitol's security and oversees Arkansas State Capitol Police. "Based on the question, the way it was framed, my mind goes to the security of lives when they are there at that Capitol," Thurston said. Gorman said voter participation and business support services are the areas that need the greatest improvement. "The next Sam Walton lives in Arkansas," Gorman said. "She might live right here in Conway, but she cannot navigate our current website." Gorman said. On cybersecurity, Thurston said he is "very confident" about the state's election security, saying federal agents will be onsite to help prevent foreign interference. "For the first time we have a cybersecurity specialist on staff, and so we put in some safeguards," he said. Gorman touted her experience on the state's Computer Science and Cybersecurity Task Force, saying she was "excited" to know the state has a full-time cybersecurity specialist but further improvements may be needed. "We have to always be vigilant because technology is ever-changing," Gorman said. "So records today might be safe, but that doesn't mean that there isn't going to be new technology or new efforts from bad actors tomorrow." On the secretary of state's role in business, Gorman criticized Thurston's management, saying shortages have slowed the office's business services role. "I absolutely intend to focus a lot of attention on this seldom talked about but very important aspect of the secretary of state's job," Gorman said. Thurston pushed back, saying he opened a satellite office in Northwest Arkansas to accommodate the booming economy there and that his office had 50,000 businesses and nonprofits register with the state during his first term. "We created the first ever secretary of state satellite office, if you will, that handles business commercial service issues," Thurston said. Both candidates said they would not support consolidating the office with other constitutional offices such as commissioner of state lands, auditor and treasurer. After the debate, candidates were invited to take questions from reporters. Gorman answered questions about voter suppression, voter participation and Capitol security. Gorman said she supports voter ID laws, but worried the state's election laws suppress voter turnout and registration. Thurston declined to participate in the post-debate news conference.

         A proposed sewer plant near Roland, the target of a Pulaski County lawsuit involving the Pinnacle Mountain Community Coalition, is not in the Lake Maumelle watershed and poses no risk of contamination to the lake or the Maumelle River. A Saturday story about the lawsuit by the coalition and nine families living near the proposed plant states that the proposed discharge of treated wastewater would increase the risk of contaminating drinking water derived from Mill Bayou.

         100 years ago Oct. 19, 1922 The matter of whether women workers in Little Rock are receiving living wages will be considered at a meeting of the Industrial Welfare Commission. ... T. A. Wilson, state labor commissioner, yesterday said that a hearing for this purpose has been considered for some time, but had been delayed because of inability of some of the members of the commission to be present. The present minimum wage is $9 a week for women in unskilled employment, and several petitions have been received protesting that this is too low. 50 years ago Oct. 19, 1972 The $200,000 in "gambling paraphernalia" seized Friday night by the FBI in raids on 11 businesses consisted of 165 pinball machines ... Affidavits, sworn to by FBI agent Edward F. McFadden, said that a year long investigation by him and other agents had produced evidence that pinball machine companies and their customers, mostly bars and pool halls, were paying off pinball players for high scores. The affidavits said that such a practice would be in violation of the federal Organized Crime Control Act of 1970. 25 years ago Oct. 19, 1997 Woo, Pig! Does the Internet have just about everything or what? Now you can download an audio version of your favorite piece of Razorback mania, the Hog Call, in three versions: short, long and longer. It's all on Hogwired, the new home page of the Arkansas Razorbacks, the men's athletic department at the University of Arkansas. Whenever you need a Razorback fix in the middle of your workday, just click on the "traditions" button on the Hogwired page to find the Hog call, get your workmates on their feet and call those Hogs. This Web site even comes with official instructions: the "woooo" part should last eight seconds, start with hands at knee level, and be sure to wiggle those fingers when you raise your hands over your head. If that's not enough, you can also download the Arkansas fight song in audio and video formats. 10 years ago Oct. 19, 2012 FORT SMITH -- Investors from Hot Springs are buying about 105 acres in the Chaffee Crossing development east of Fort Smith with plans to build a major shopping center, according to a Hot Springs real estate agent and Chaffee Crossing officials. The retail center would be in Barling. One important issue is whether voters in the town, population about 4,649, approve alcohol sales in the Nov. 6 general election. ... The larger shopping center, if built, could employ up to 700 people at department stores, restaurants, motels and apartments, said Darrell Allison of Diamondhead Realty in Hot Springs, a real estate agent working with investors and a Dallas developer. ... The proposed shopping center would be the biggest commercial project so far at Chaffee Crossing, which has been one of Arkansas' busiest development spots in recent years.

        A conservative political action organization on Tuesday unveiled a three-prong strategy it will use in an effort to get the proposed constitutional amendment known as Issue 3 passed in November. Family Council Action Committee officials said the group will coordinate with volunteers and churches from across Arkansas to distribute fliers in support of the Arkansas Religious Freedom amendment and form a coalition of faith leaders who support religious liberty. Issue 3, proposed by Sen. Jason Rapert, R-Conway, would add language to the Arkansas Constitution that would prohibit government from burdening a person's freedom of religion unless the government can demonstrate it furthers a compelling government interest and is the least restrictive means of furthering that interest. The committee's executive director, Jerry Cox, said Issue 3 is necessary to prevent the "further erosion" of religious freedom while acknowledging that such efforts aren't much of a threat currently in Arkansas. "People might say, 'Well, is religious freedom under attack in Arkansas?' Not that much, and we want to keep it that way," Cox said. "In fact, I hope that no one will ever have to use this religious freedom amendment to defend their right to express their religion, but if they do it will be there." Cox said religious freedom is under attack around the world and cited a 2018 Pew Research study that showed religious persecution and harassment are on the rise, including in the United States. He said the U.S. Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v Wade earlier this year shows people cannot always rely on federal law and federal courts to sort out which rights are protected. Holly Dickson, executive director of the ACLU of Arkansas, said that while religious freedom is a fundamental right, it is not an excuse to discriminate. "If enacted, Issue 3 would be among the most extreme of its kind in the country, putting Arkansas out of step with existing constitutional standards that protect our religious liberty and all other civil rights and liberties," Dickson said. "It could give folks a new argument to make to be exempt from every law or regulation -- civil, regulatory, child abuse, fire code, traffic, domestic abuse and even criminal." Arkansas state senators and representatives voted in 2021 to place Issue 3 on the 2022 General Election ballot. The state's Constitution grants the legislature the right to include up to three constitutional amendments on the General Election ballot. The amendment also adds language to the state's Constitution that provides a legal claim in a court or other governmental proceeding for a person to seek relief against the government for imposing on their religious freedom. Cox said if government burdens a person's freedom of religion, it has to do it in the least-restrictive means possible. The campaign for Issue 3 will involve around 300 volunteers across the state, Cox said. The organization has printed about 350,000 flyers giving reasons why voters should support Issue 3. Cox said the flyers, which include the headline "Don't let them cancel your faith," will be distributed through churches around the state.  Print Headline: Conservative organization pushes Issue 3

         Law enforcement officers in Paragould on Tuesday responded to three violent incidents, thought to be unrelated, that left two people dead and three more, one of them a police officer, injured by gunfire, according to a Facebook post from the city Police Department. One of the incidents was a shootout between police and a man who opened fire at them, another was a domestic disturbance resulting in a fatal stabbing, and the third was an armed robbery where one person was shot, according to the post. The first incident occurred after officers arrived at a home in the 100 block of South Rockingchair Road around 7:14 a.m. after getting a report of an unwanted person on the property. A man started shooting at officers shortly after they made contact, and police returned fire. One officer and a resident at the address were struck by gunfire, and police later found the gunman dead. The Facebook post did not specify who killed him. The injured officer was being treated at a Memphis hospital Tuesday for injuries that were not thought to be life-threatening. No information was given about the condition of the resident who was shot. Authorities did not identify the officer, the suspect, or the other person wounded. The post stated that the officers involved would be identified "at the appropriate time." In line with Paragould Police Department policy, the Arkansas State Police will lead an investigation into the officers' use of force to determine whether their actions were legal. The Greene County Tech Middle School and Junior High campuses were temporarily placed on "soft lockdown" because of the nearby shooting, according to posts on the school district's website. Around 7:20 a.m, just six minutes after the shootout on Rockingchair Road, members of Paragould Emergency Services got a 911 call about a domestic disturbance at a home in the 200 block of North 181/2 Avenue. That address is on the other side of town from the shooting -- roughly five miles away. Because all Paragould officers were responding to the shooting, Greene County sheriff's deputies responded, finding a man inside the home with fatal knife wounds. Paragould police detectives arrived at the scene and began an investigation. The victim was not identified, no suspect was named and no details were given of the confrontation that led to the stabbing. Police responded to the third incident after receiving a report of a shooting around 12:28 p.m. in the 400 block of North Fifth Street. Officers found a man with a gunshot wound in his upper torso, the Facebook post says. He was airlifted to a Memphis hospital for treatment. His condition was not given in the post, which said the shooting stemmed from an attempted armed robbery.  Print Headline: Paragould police look into incidents

         BENTONVILLE -- Vector Xiong, a Benton County sheriff's office detective, was identified by the office Monday as the detective who fatally shot a Decatur man Saturday. Xiong is on paid administrative leave while the Arkansas State Police investigates the shooting, according to Lt. Shannon Jenkins, the spokeswoman for the sheriff's office. Xiong has worked with the sheriff's office since March 16, 2015, Jenkins said. Deputies were called to 22891 Falling Springs Road shortly before noon Saturday after a resident reported gunfire being heard on Nelson Amos' property, according to a news release from the state police. Xiong encountered Amos, 71, on a local road driving a tractor and brandishing a handgun, according to the release. The deputy fired his rifle, striking Amos, according to the release. Amos was pronounced dead at the scene, according to the release. Special agents of the state police's Criminal Investigation Division are preparing an investigative file to be submitted to Benton County Prosecuting Attorney Nathan Smith, who will determine whether the use of deadly force by the sheriff's detective was consistent with Arkansas laws, according to the release.

        Gunfire kills dog in shots at garage Little Rock police were investigating a shooting incident from Friday afternoon that left a dog dead. Officers met with Jose Perez and Terri Perez, whose garage had been struck by a bullet, at 8400 Baseline Road. The two said they had received “vague” threats from previous tenants. Police searched the property and found a projectile inside the Perezes shop. The search also revealed that their dog, which was in a cage behind the shop, had been struck and killed by gunfire. Police took the projectile for evidence. Woman attacked at intersection Little Rock police responded to the Shell Station at 10101 Interstate 30 just after midnight Sunday after a woman reported being assaulted by an unknown man. Officers said the victim had visible injuries to her face and both arms and was bleeding in multiple places. The woman, 40, stated that she believed her ribs were broken, but declined treatment, adding that “she just wanted to do the report and go home.” According to the report, the womans husband arrived and said he would follow her home and try to convince her to go to the hospital. The report says she had been stopped at a stoplight with her windows down when an unknown man approached the vehicle, punched her in the face, opened her door and shoved her into the passenger seat. She told officers she kept her head down to keep him from hitting her, then decided to “take action.” The woman grabbed the steering wheel — pulling the vehicle into a parking lot — before hitting the horn as much as she could and yelling. Two vehicles pulled into the parking lot behind her vehicle . Her attacker walked away from the vehicle after two strangers intervened.

         Ted A. Lewis, a finalist for chancellor at the University of Arkansas-Pulaski Technical College, said at a public forum Tuesday one of the most critical qualities for a leader is the ability to listen and entertain new notions. If hired, he said he would be "open, transparent and consistent" in communication, and he'd never ask anyone to do anything he wouldn't do himself, nor anything that violated personal beliefs or ethics. He said he believes in shared governance, accomplishing things as a team. "I believe in leading by example -- I'm approachable, accessible, and compassionate, particularly with students -- and I'll be visible all over campus," he said. Lewis said he understands students at colleges like Pulaski Tech, especially first-generation college students -- as he was. He said they need support to succeed, and if those tools for success are in place, enrollment and retention will follow. "We have to continue to recruit students, but also retain them [by] providing the services and resources to keep them," Lewis said. That includes "getting them off on the right foot" from the start of their college experience with offerings like new student orientation, Student Success contracts, block schedules, and course guarantees. Lewis, provost/vice president of academic and student affairs at Bluefield State University in West Virginia. said Student Success contracts serve as "commitment" from students to attend classes and complete their assignments. Block schedules create predictability and a cohort, and "students won't be off schedule" if courses are offered as promised. Enrollment at Pulaski Tech has decreased for three consecutive years, down to 4,223 this fall from 4,425 in 2021, 4,833 in 2020, and 5,531 in 2019, part of a national trend, especially for community colleges. But Bluefield State turned around enrollment declines and increased enrollment -- even during the covid-19 pandemic -- with several initiatives led by Lewis, he said. For example, his school developed individual student success plans for students at risk of dropping out, and "we've just started" a new program where college staff members will call every student who hasn't graduated and who hasn't registered for classes for the following semester. While visiting Pulaski Tech on Tuesday, Lewis met with various campus, community, and University of Arkansas System stakeholders, as fellow finalist Wade Derden, vice president for academic affairs at National Park College in Hot Springs, did Monday, and finalist Summer DeProw, provost/vice chancellor for academic and student affairs at UA-PTC, will do next Monday. It's important to increase access for underrepresented and underserved students, which can be accomplished in various ways, from summer camps on campus that "create a culture," to boosting concurrent enrollment courses, to increasing articulation agreements with other institutions to facilitate simple credit transfers, said Lewis, who has a Bachelor of Arts in political science from Texas Wesleyan University, a Master of Science in political science from the University of North Texas, and a Doctorate of Education (with distinction) in educational administration, with a specialization in community college leadership, from the University of Texas at Austin. Other resources -- from a clothes closet so students can "look professional" for job interviews, to career services, to paid internships, to peer mentoring -- are invaluable, as well. Non-traditional students ought not be overlooked, either, so online courses, hybrid classes, and evening and weekend courses should all be considered, Lewis said. Increasing advertising through social media can pay dividends, and utilizing recruiting teams of faculty, staff, current students, and alumni is judicious, said Lewis, who was vice president of academic affairs and chief academic officer at Pellissippi State Community College in Knoxville, Tenn., before moving to West Virginia. Current students meeting with potential students is powerful, and testaments from alumni can work wonders with prospective students and their parents. Reducing the bureaucracy of enrollment is necessary, as is working with industry and businesses to perhaps create new academic programs that will attract students, he said. It's also paramount to make sure tutoring, computer lab, and library hours meet students' needs. In order to pay for services and resources, Lewis would make fundraising a priority, try to boost philanthropy, and look to secure grants, he said. He'd also work with local, state, and national leaders and policymakers on funding, emphasizing that investing in the college will pay dividends with a skilled workforce and potential entrepreneurs. The median career salary for someone with only a high school degree is $42,000, but that increases to $50,000 for someone with an associate degree, he said. Over a 40-year career, that equates to a difference of $320,000. Lewis was founding Dean of Instruction at Lone Star College-CyFair, a professor of political science and department chair at Collin College in Texas, and director of Collin College's national Bellwether Award-winning learning communities program, according to the UA System. Making sure staff members are prepared to teach is also crucial, and Lewis has spent much of his career working with instructors to ensure their effectiveness, he said. "I loved working with students and being in the classroom," he said, adding that "going into administration was one of the hardest things I ever did." But he said he realized he could impact more students by helping teachers be better than he could by teaching only his own students. However, "I still continue to teach," as it's valuable for him to understand the needs of -- and challenges facing -- students and instructors, he said. "I like to be in the campus community," not cloistered in an office. Pulaski Tech is positioned to thrive, because the college has measurable, attainable goals, it invests in students, employees, and the community, and the community invests back into the college, Lewis said. That last piece -- the community investment -- "really impressed me." Resources for students, from scholarships to a food pantry, and possibilities for dual credit and concurrent enrollment "build momentum" with students before they reach college age, he said. In addition, the campus is open to the community, the college supports faculty and staff who wish to continue their own education and/or become more proficient in their profession, and the college has myriad student organizations -- student involvement is paramount to student success. The search committee evaluated applicants from 17 states, and interim chancellor Ana Hunt, who did not apply for the full-time chancellor job, "will continue to serve as interim until one of the finalists is chosen and begins their work" at the college, according to the UA System. Hunt was appointed interim by UA System President Donald Bobbitt in June after the retirement of then-Chancellor Margaret Ellibee, who announced in January her intent to retire effective June 30. "We have a very compassionate and caring group of people here, so I hope our new leader will be the same," said Hunt. The next chancellor also needs to be "student-focused, and I believe all three of these [finalists] have those" qualities. UA-PTC, the UA System's largest two-year college, was established in 1945 as a vocational-technical school, but it has evolved to meet varying education needs. Besides its main campus in North Little Rock, the college has locations across Pulaski and Saline Counties.  Print Headline: UA-PTC finalist says ability to listen critical

        A teenager faces a murder charge connected to a homicide last week after he turned himself in to Little Rock police on Tuesday, according to a tweet from the department. Joshua Thomas, 19, of Little Rock, surrendered to detectives Tuesday and was charged with first-degree murder and first-degree battery in the killing of Barry Campbell, 34, and the wounding of Frederick Jordan, 65, both of Little Rock. Police found the two shot at 4423 West 12th St. shortly before 4:45 p.m. on Oct. 12, and Campbell died of his injuries. Authorities had not previously named Thomas as a suspect in the slaying. He was held in the Pulaski County jail Tuesday night, an online inmate roster showed, and no bond was listed.

        A second day of testimony concluded Tuesday in a federal trial to decide the constitutionality of the state's first-in-the nation ban on health care for teens suffering from gender dysphoria with powerful and emotional testimony from the fathers of two of the teens at the center of the legal struggle between four families and the state of Arkansas.  Donnie Saxton of Vilonia, father of 17-year-old Parker Saxton, testified to the change in his son since Parker began gender affirmation therapy, going from depressed and withdrawn to an enthusiastic teenager brimming with confidence. Saxton spoke in glowing terms about the change in his son under questioning by Beth Echols, a Little Rock attorney working on the lawsuit.  "He's a new person," Saxton said. " A complete turnaround of the broken, anxious, depressed shell that he was before testosterone. It's amazing. Truly amazing."  "Does he have more confidence than he did before?" Echols asked.  "He's got huge confidence," Saxton said, with a laugh, "almost too much at times but that's good. He's kind of like his old dad so that's good."  Aaron Jennen of Fayetteville said his daughter, 17-year-old Sabrina, was also much more confident and although still prone to bouts of depression, had experienced a significant turnaround in her demeanor after beginning hormone therapy.  "She's doing great," Jennen said. "Her dysphoria has been largely alleviated." Stopping treatment, Jennen said, is not under consideration.  "I promise you that will not happen," he said.  Asked what might happen to Parker if gender affirming care should be withdrawn, Saxton's face grew dark with emotion.  "I won't think about that," he said. "I just won't."  ACLU lawyers said they expect to call their final witnesses on Wednesday at which time the state will begin presenting its case.  10:48: Child development psychiatrist testifies in trial over Arkansas law banning transgender care for minors As the trial on the state's transgender health ban entered its second day, a child development psychiatrist testified Tuesday morning on international guidelines that recommend chest surgeries for only a small percentage of transgender boys. Regarding chest surgery for young adolescent transgender boys as young as 13 or 14, Dr. Jack Turban, a child development psychiatrist with the University of California at San Francisco, said he would need more information regarding what patients the state's attorney, Michael Cantrell, was referring to when the question was asked.  "Surgery is a major decision," he said. "The risk of complications is very high." Under questioning by ACLU attorney Chase Strangio, Turban said no randomized studies of the long-term effects of transgender care exist because the characteristics of randomized control trials cannot mask the physical changes between those receiving gender affirming hormone treatment and those receiving placebos. Turban also said few parents are willing to place their children into such trials.  "Parents are reluctant to put their children into randomized control trials because in the placebo group," Turban said, "we would expect their mental health to get worse." He said that, by and large, studies on the long-term effects of transgender care for adolescents have indicated that mental health outcomes for adolescents suffering from gender dysphoria are improved over adolescents with gender dysphoria who did not receive gender-affirming treatment. Regarding the use of puberty blockers in pre-pubescent patients, he said there is no data to suggest that those patients suffered mental health declines as the result of the therapy. The bench trial, which will decide the constitutionality of Arkansas' transgender health care ban, began Monday morning.

        Paragould police on Tuesday responded to three violent incidents, thought to be unrelated, that left two people dead and three more — one of them a police officer — shot, according to a Facebook post from the department. One of the incidents was a shootout between police and a man who opened fire at them, another was a domestic disturbance resulting in a fatal stabbing and the third was an armed robbery where one person was shot. Officers arrived at a home in the 100 block of South Rockingchair Road around 7:14 a.m. after getting a report of an unwanted person on the property, the post states. A man started shooting at officers shortly after they made contact, and police returned fire. One officer and a resident at the address were struck by gunfire, and police later found the shooter dead, although the post did not specify who killed him. The injured officer was being treated in a Memphis hospital Tuesday, and their injuries were not thought to be life-threatening. No information was given about the resident that was shot. Authorities did not identify the officer, the suspect, or the other person wounded. The post stated that the officers involved would be identified "at the appropriate time." In line with departmental policy, Arkansas State Police will lead an investigation into the officers' use of force to determine that their actions were legal. The Green County Tech Middle School and Junior High campuses were temporarily placed on "soft lockdown" because of the nearby shooting, according to posts on the school district's website. Around 7:20 a.m., just six minutes after the shootout on Rockingchair Road, members of Paragould Emergency Services re a 911 call about a domestic disturbance at a home in the 200 block of North 18½ Avenue. That address is on the other side of town from the shooting incident, roughly five miles away. All Paragould officers were responding to the earlier shooting, Greene County deputies responded, finding a man inside the home with fatal knife wounds. Paragould police detectives arrived at the scene and began an investigation. The victim was not identified, no suspect was named and no details of the confrontation that led to the stabbing were given. The third incident began with Paragould officers responding to a report of a shooting around 12:28 p.m. in the 400 block of North Fifth Street. Police found a man with a gunshot wound in his upper torso, the post states, and he was airlifted to a Memphis hospital for treatment. His condition was not given in the post, nor was it clear how he was related to the incident, which police labeled as an attempted armed robbery.

        Officers arrested a 39-year-old man after a homicide on Interstate 30 in Little Rock overnight, police said on Tuesday. Demontra Hatfield of Benton has been arrested in the murder of 61-year-old Benton resident Larry Foster, the department said on Twitter.  Police said the homicide happened in the 12800 block of the frontage road. A news release from Little Rock police said Foster was dead at the scene.  Hatfield is being charged with capital murder, first-degree domestic battery and first-degree child endangering, according to the tweet. He was booked into Pulaski County jail, where he remained Tuesday morning, an online inmate roster indicates. Benton police are also charging Hatfield in the murder of a 28-year-old woman.  Officers responded to a welfare check at a Country Oaks Apartments in Benton around 1:30 a.m. on Tuesday after a minor was brought to a Little Rock hospital for a gunshot wound, a news release from Benton police said. Little Rock police said in the release that the minor was Hatfields daughter and that she was being treated for non-life threatening-injuries.  Police determined Hatfield shot and killed Krystle Wilder and fled the scene with the body and the minor before killing Foster in Little Rock, the Benton release said.  Benton police have charged Hatfield with first-degree murder in the death of Wilder, abuse of a corpse, possession of firearm by certain persons, tampering with physical evidence and endangering the welfare of a minor.   “The investigation is ongoing, and additional charges may be forthcoming,” the news release said.  Krista Petty, a spokesperson for the Benton Police Department, said in a text to the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette that due to the investigation being ongoing, police could not say whether or not Hatfield shot his daughter.  CORRECTION: Demontra Hatfield is a resident of Benton. The Little Rock Police Department incorrectly stated his place of residence on Tuesday. An earlier version of this article contained the error, which the department corrected later.

        Owens Corning is further expanding its new Fort Smith manufacturing facility, investing $24.5 million in machinery and new construction expected to create 50 jobs. The company began building a 550,000 square-foot plant on Planter Road adjacent to the company's existing Fort Smith facility in early 2021 where it will make fiberglass composite, insulation and roofing materials. At the time Owens Corning said it would invest more that $107 million on the new facility. It's expected to be completed in 2023. "Expanding Owens Corning's nonwovens production in this highly advanced facility will help us better serve our customers' long-term growth. We are excited to add capacity in Fort Smith and create additional jobs in a community that we have been a part of for 37 years," Rachel Marcon, vice president and general manager of nonwovens, Owens Corning, said in a Tuesday statement. The company began making products in Fort Smith in 1985. The plant makes nonwoven products like fiberglass mat used in roofing. Once the new facility is completed, the existing plant will shut down and the workers will transfer to the new location. The Fort Smith operation currently employs 93 workers, a company spokesman said Tuesday. "These jobs will go a long way in changing lives in an area that has been known for its manufacturing community for more than half a century," Gov. Asa Hutchinson said in a statement. According to the company's 2021 annual report, the Fort Smith location is one of 28 plants worldwide in Owens Corning's composites segment. Toledo, Ohio-based Owens Corning employs 20,000 in 33 countries and was founded in 1938. It posed 2021 revenue of $8.5 billion. In addition to the Owens Corning expansion, Fort Smith has seen other manufacturers invest locally recently In September 2021, Mars Petcare said it will invest $120 million at its Fort Smith plant, adding 140 new full-time jobs. That news came after the company said it would invest $145 adding two production lines. The projects are expected to be completed in 2023. In January 2021, Jonesboro-based Hytrol Conveyor Co. said it will invest $20 million in a new Fort Smith facility expected to add 250 jobs over five years, and in September the company said it wants to add 100 more jobs at the site. "This expansion is a perfect example of the partnership between the Arkansas Department of Commerce, Fort Smith Regional Chamber and the City of Fort Smith and how we work together toward one unified goal." Tim Allen, president and chief executive officer of the Fort Smith Regional Chamber of Commerce said in a statement. "I truly appreciate Owens Corning and their continued commitment and investment in our community." According to a spokesman for the Arkansas Economic Development Commission, Owens Corning's new project qualified for two state incentive packages, the Tax Back Program and seven years of the Create Rebate Program. Shares of Owens Corning closed at $86.60, up $4.17 or 5% in trading Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares have traded as low as $72.97 and as high as $101.12 over the past year.

        WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden on Monday officially kicked off the application process for his student debt cancellation program, opening the door for millions of Americans to apply for up to $20,000 in forgiveness. The Biden administration touts it as a simple, straightforward application that should only take about five minutes. Here's how to apply. Go to studentaid.gov and in the section on student loan debt relief, click "Apply Now." Be ready to type in some basic personal information. The form asks for: name, Social Security Number, date of birth, phone number and email address. It does not require documentation about your income or your student loans. Next, review the eligibility rules and confirm that you're a match. For most people, that means attesting that they make less than $125,000 a year or that their household makes less than $250,000 a year. If you meet the eligibility rules, click the box confirming that everything you provided is true. Click "Submit." After the form is submitted, the Biden administration says it should take four to six weeks to process. The Education Department will use its existing records to make sure your loans are eligible and to look for applicants who might exceed the income limits. Some will be asked to provide additional documentation to prove their incomes. The Education Department estimates that the verification application will take about half an hour, including time to review and upload tax documents. Most borrowers who apply before mid-November should expect to get their debt canceled before Jan. 1, when payments on federal student loans are scheduled to restart after a pause during the pandemic. Things could get more complicated, depending on the outcomes of several legal challenges. The Biden administration faces a growing number of lawsuits attempting to block the program, including one filed by six Republican-led states. A federal judge in St. Louis is currently weighing the states' request for an injunction to halt the plan. Biden on Monday said he's confident that the suit will not upend the plan. "Our legal judgment is that it won't," he said, "but they're trying to stop it."

        FAYETTEVILLE -- Members of the Advertising and Promotion Commission asked for more information on TheatreSquared's financials as the commission considers its annual payment toward the theater facility's construction cost. Martin Miller, executive director for TheatreSquared, gave the commission a presentation on the professional theater's history, operation and challenges experienced during the pandemic. The presentation and questions from commissioners lasted about an hour. The commission in 2017 committed $3 million toward TheatreSquared's construction, made in payments of $200,000 over 15 years. However, the commission retains the ability to cease payments if it wants, according to Vince Chadick, the commission's hired attorney. Nearly 30% of TheatreSquared's $31.5 million construction cost has come from public sources, Miller told the commission. The state committed $2.9 million and the city committed $3.1 million, in addition to the $3 million from the commission, totaling $9 million. The rest of the cost has come from private sources, he said. The money goes toward a construction loan for the facility, Miller said. The bank made the loan based on the commission's unanimous support at the time, he said. The vote was 6-0 in 2017. Chrissy Sanderson is the only member who voted at the time who is still on the commission. The commission began reviewing some of its expenditures in the wake of the pandemic. One such decision happened in 2020 to cut the yearly budget for the Clinton House Museum from about $250,000 to $40,000, with the expectation the museum's nonprofit board would take over operation. Commission Chairman Todd Martin said he wanted more information on how TheatreSquared operates financially before the commission makes another $200,000 payment. He had questions over how donations are reflected in TheatreSquared's budget, how the in-house cafe and bar plays into the operation and details on TheatreSquared's nonprofit status. "I do understand as a public entity we need to support the arts, and I'm very much in favor of that," Martin said. "But I do also want to understand where we where are in regard to the financials, in depth." Molly Rawn, chief executive officer of the city's tourism bureau Experience Fayetteville, said the commission so far has made four payments, but hasn't yet made the payment for this year. Commissioner Elvis Moya asked Miller for more information on out-of-town attendance. Miller said in the presentation about 48% of attendees come from outside the city. Revenue has exceeded expenses since TheatreSquared's opening in 2019. The professional theater continued programming through the pandemic without laying off staff by using emergency aid measures such as the Paycheck Protection Program from the U.S. Small Business Administration, he said. Those emergency aid measures are running out, he said. TheatreSquared has an application submitted with the city for about $1.2 million in assistance from the American Rescue Plan. "We will end the year with a deficit if we don't find some additional funds to replace those ticket sales which are still depressed, even though we budgeted conservatively," Miller said. Attendance has slowly ticked up but is still about 40% of what it was before the pandemic, he said. Construction loan payments are not optional, Miller said. If the commission stopped payment on its 15-year pledge, TheatreSquared's operation would suffer -- weakening or eliminating its arts and education programs, he said. "We're grateful for the A&P's unanimous, visionary commitment that helped get this new cultural landmark build," Miller said. "I anticipate they'll stay true to that commitment." Miller said he would provide more information to the commission for its next meeting in November.  By the numbers 59% of 1,200 respondents said they dined out or bought a drink at another business before or after a show at TheatreSquared.

        A bench trial to decide the constitutionality of Arkansas' transgender health care ban -- passed in 2021 but temporarily blocked before it could go into effect -- got off to a rocky start Monday morning. First, attorneys for the ACLU and the Arkansas attorney general's office were caught by surprise upon learning the court schedule in U.S. District Judge James M. Moody Jr.'s court could only accommodate one week of testimony. Both sides came to court Monday planning for a two-week trial. Dylan Jacobs and Michael Cantrell, both attorneys with the attorney general's office, told Moody they had witnesses coming from out of state who were supposed to come in next week. Then, less than two hours into the start of testimony, a fire alarm forced the evacuation of the courthouse for nearly a half-hour until the Little Rock Fire Department determined it was a false alarm. Act 626 of 2021 -- the Save Adolescents From Experimentation Act -- was passed in April 2021 after the state House and Senate voted by large margins to override a veto by Gov. Asa Hutchinson. The law was challenged in a suit filed the following month by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of four transgender teens and their families living in Arkansas and two physicians, Michele Hutchison and Kathryn Stambaugh. It named Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge, Arkansas State Medical Board Director Amy Embry and the 14 members of the medical board as defendants. The lawsuit contends the law violates the equal protection and due process clauses of the 14th Amendment and free speech protections under the First Amendment. In July 2021, Moody issued a temporary injunction blocking enforcement while the matter is in court. An appeal by the attorney general's office, which is responsible for defending the state in lawsuits, was denied in August by a three-judge panel of the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals. A request by Rutledge for a hearing by the full Eighth Circuit is currently pending. The law -- authored by Republican Rep. Robin Lundstrum of Elm Springs and passed on primarily party-line votes -- would prohibit doctors from providing or referring transgender young people care related to gender dysphoria. The condition is defined by the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., as the feeling of discomfort or distress that might occur in people whose gender identity differs from their sex at birth or sex-related physical characteristics. On Monday morning, Moody announced the change to the consternation of both sides. "I was told that Friday the parties were informed that despite the fact that you had asked for two weeks the court had scheduled one week for this case," Moody said. Attorneys for the ACLU said they were under the impression that the court would be able to take some testimony next week, which Moody said was not the case. "We can go as late as you need to at night to make up for that but this case is scheduled in light of all the depositions taken in this case and the fact that it's been to the Eighth Circuit and back on several issues," Moody said. "This case is going to get done this week or you can come back later, maybe in December." Monday's testimony was presented by two expert witnesses for the plaintiffs: Dr. Dan Karasic, a psychiatrist from San Francisco who has spent more than 30 years treating patients with gender dysphoria, and Dr. Deanna Adkins, a pediatric endocrinologist from Duke Children's Hospital and Health Center in Durham, N.C. Karasic testified most of the day, beginning at 9:30 a.m. and stepping off the witness stand just after 4 p.m. His testimony was primarily comprised of the protocols for diagnosing gender dysphoria, standards of care established by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health and the consequences of individuals with gender dysphoria receiving improper care or no care at all. Karasic said he was on the committee that established the WPATH Standards of Care 7 in 2011 and the revised WPATH Standards of Care 8, which was released last September. Karasic said the symptoms of gender dysphoria in patients before receiving treatment include severe distress or pain and withdrawal from society. "Many patients have withdrawn from school or, in the case of older people, jobs," he said. "They become quite impaired as far as their relationships with other people." He said people suffering from gender dysphoria often suffer elevated rates of depression or anxiety and are prone to suicidal ideations, attempts or self-mutilation. Asked by Cantrell if there are providers who violate the guidelines laid out in the WPATH Standards of Care, Karasic said that could not be ruled out but said it was more of an exception and that every discipline has had instances of bad actors. "Just because there are bad or irresponsible providers out there is no more reason to ban transgender care than it is to ban any other kind of care," he said. "Transgender care is not unique in the medical field." Adkins described the use of puberty blockers and hormonal therapy to treat gender dysphoria and the process of evaluating patients and their families, and she stressed that all therapies are individualized to the patient. She said surgical interventions such as feminizing vaginoplasty for transgender females and masculinizing phalloplasty for transgender males are not recommended for minor patients and are not performed at Duke. Stopping hormonal treatment, she said, leads to adverse psychological effects as well as permanent physical changes that often lead to adverse outcomes for patients, she said. "I've seen it in my practice," she said. "I lost a patient to suicide because they did not make it to their second visit when we would have been able to potentially start gender affirming hormone treatment at that time." "Is it possible to wait until they turn 18?" Chase Strangio with the ACLU asked. "Not for that patient," Adkins said. "For many of my patients the risks are real." Holly Dickson, executive director of ACLU of Arkansas, said in a text message after the hearing Monday night that several plaintiffs were in the courtroom to hear the first day of testimony. She said any hurdles that might come up would be dealt with as needed, including coming back to conclude the trial in December. "We'll do whatever we can and need to do to overcome timing, scheduling or other obstacles in our work to protect these amazing young people from their politicians," Dickson said.

        Steve Womack's opponents hammered him during a debate Monday for not getting more done during his 12 years in Congress. "Our current representative touts that he knows what the 3rd Congressional District needs, yet he's been in office for 12 years and has only had one bill passed into law for a commemorative coin," Lauren Mallett-Hays, the Democratic Party's nominee, said in her closing comments in the Arkansas PBS debate held in Conway. "He doesn't care about the people who are struggling to put food on the table and a roof over their heads," said Mallett-Hayes. "He doesn't care about the food-insecure neighbors that we have all throughout our district. He doesn't care about the shortages we're seeing in education labor and service-worker labor. He doesn't care about the burnout that our health care workers are seeing or that parents are concerned about their children getting the best education no matter where they live in the district. "If he cared about all of those things, he would have been working on legislation over the last 12 years that address all Arkansans. I don't have to tell you how bad of a job he's done because his track record will do that for me. But I can tell you as your next congresswoman, I will fight tirelessly to rebuild our communities and bring a voice back to the 3rd Congressional District." Womack didn't respond during his closing comments. He used the time instead to thank Arkansas PBS, his opponents and his staff. But he responded during a news conference afterward. "When my opponent started off on this whole tangent about 'Steve Womack's ineffective because he's only got one bill signed into law,' I want to correct some record here," Womack said. "It demonstrates her lack of understanding how Congress works. When I went to Congress, I had a chance to get on some of these authorizing committees, but no, I wanted to be an appropriator. I wanted to be a difference maker. And I knew the appropriations committee, it's an 'A' committee in Congress for a reason, because nothing happens on the discretionary side of the budget unless Congress approves appropriation bills." Womack has served on the House Appropriations Committee for 12 years. He is the committee's senior member. "So across the spectrum of 12 appropriation bills, I've had a hand in influencing the outcomes that have benefited not only our state and nation, but 3rd District Arkansans specifically," Womack said. "So everything from language reauthorizing the 12-foot channel in the [McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System] that I don't think she would even begin to understand the importance to the economy, to things like money for I-49, XNA, Camp Jack in Harrison, a sewer project in Yellville, a park in Goshen, a [Supporting Lifelong Success] campus in Fayetteville. I could talk ad nauseam about the number of things that we've been able to do through the language that we put in appropriation bills that help my district, our state and our nation. You don't have to have your name on a bill for it to be something that's truly effective for the people you serve." The bill Mallett-Hays was referring to, the one that Womack sponsored and that became law, was H.R. 886, the United States Marshals Service 225th Anniversary Commemorative Coin Act, which was passed by Congress in 2011. The coin sales provide funding for the United States Marshals Museum in Fort Smith. "You don't hear anybody down there complaining about it," said Womack. "That produced about $4 million in revenue for a very important destination-quality museum for the U.S. Marshals Service. "So we do a lot of things that maybe don't show up in the box score that she chose to assail here today." Also challenging Womack is Michael Kalagias, a Libertarian. He also ran against Womack in 2018 and 2020. The 3rd Congressional District has been a Republican stronghold since 1967. At one point during Monday's debate, referring to the covid-19 pandemic, Womack said traveling nurses were "gouging" people because they "can charge exorbitant rates for the services they provide." Kalagias didn't see it that way. "More power to them that they are going to get paid for their skills ..." he said. "God bless the people that are leaving to get enough money to pay them for what they're worth. Calling them evil, saying they're gouging people because they're going to get the money they deserve, that's not an answer to the problem. An answer to the problem is in fact training more people that are capable of doing the job." In his comments, Womack didn't say the nurses were evil. Womack and Mallett-Hays agreed on the U.S. aiding Ukraine in its battle against Russia. "We cannot afford for eastern Europe to be overrun by an unchecked Vladimir Putin, and he's trying to reclaim exactly what was dissolved in late '80s, early '90s," said Womack. "So I support the United States of America helping our allies so that we never have to trigger an Article 5 response in NATO [an attack against one NATO member being considered an attack on all of them]. And I promise you, if he's unchecked, if he's able to take Ukraine, he's going to take Georgia. He's going to take the rest of those Soviet bloc countries, and he's going to run roughshod over the rest of Europe, and that's something our country and the rest of the world simply cannot afford." Kalagias had a somewhat different opinion. "I would just like to remind everybody that our country was attacked in World War II," said Kalagias. "We were justified in going to war then. Putin hasn't attacked us. So, at a certain point, Europe is going to have to be able to solve their own problems. Because ... we can't afford to be the world's policeman." Moderator Steve Barnes said there's legislation in the Senate to make abortion illegal nationwide following the reversal of Roe v. Wade in June. He asked the candidates their opinions. Mallett-Hays said she wouldn't support that legislation. "Abortion has become this very politicized thing, but when we look at the root of what abortion is, it is a medical procedure that is warranted at times," she said. "And there is nobody that needs to make that decision besides the female and her medical providers." "I think a lot of times we're having the wrong argument," said Kalagias. "We shouldn't be arguing over what medical procedure should or shouldn't be allowed. This is a rights argument. So, should all people get equal protection under the law or not? So I believe everyone should get equal protection under the law and that includes children." Womack said the Dobbs ruling pushed the decision back to the states, and Arkansas had a trigger law to ban abortion except to save the life of the mother in a medical emergency. "I believe on issues like this that are so close and so emotionally charged that the best place for those issues to be decided is closest to the people," said Womack, meaning on the state level. "But that said, I support a federal ban on abortions with certain exemptions, certain exceptions." The election will be held Nov. 8.  Print Headline: Opponents hammer Womack

         An incumbent and two challengers who consider themselves political outsiders agreed Monday on several topics during a U.S. Congressional District 4 debate in Conway, but responses from the Democratic candidate led to the state's party distancing itself from his platform. U.S. Rep. Bruce Westerman, a Republican from Hot Springs, was joined at the Arkansas PBS debate by Democratic candidate John White of Stephens and Libertarian candidate Gregory Maxwell of Dover on the campus of the University of Central Arkansas. The debate covered questions about inflation, national debt, recreational marijuana and abortion, but much of the discussion centered on the Jan. 6 riot in Washington, D.C., and controversy surrounding the 2020 presidential election. Shortly after the debate concluded, the chairman of Arkansas' Democratic Party issued a statement saying the party did not endorse comments made by White during the debate. "Earlier today, the Democratic nominee for U.S. Congress-District 4 made numerous statements inconsistent with our Party's positions," Democratic Party of Arkansas chairman Grant Tennille said in a news release. "The Party does not endorse the candidate's stated positions. While the Democratic Party did not recruit John White to run, we honor the access to the ballot that is fundamental to American democracy and thank Mr. White for his military service to our country." Debate panelist Byron Tate, editor of the Pine Bluff Commercial, led off the debate by noting that a recent poll shows 60% to 80% of Republicans don't believe President Joe Biden was legitimately elected, and he asked candidates their opinion on the election's outcome. White said he believes the 2020 presidential election was stolen. "I don't believe Biden got more votes than President Obama," White said of Biden's more than 81 million votes, the most ever cast for a U.S. presidential election candidate. "Just my opinion, and I can't prove it." Westerman said there were "anomalies" in the 2020 election and that he signed an amicus brief asking the U.S. Supreme Court to look into the results, but he noted the process "ran its due course and the state certified it, and Biden is the president." "Unfortunately [Biden] has been the president for the last two years and we have seen the results, which has America in a recession and increasing food costs," Westerman added. Maxwell said he doesn't believe in polls because he believes they are skewed by the mainstream media. Tate asked if there should be concern regarding the election process because of the number of Republican nominees who have disputed the 2020 results. Westerman said it's time to move on from the 2020 election and the Jan. 6 riot. "I know the mainstream media and Democrats want to focus on Jan. 6, but the American people want to focus on the economy and higher food prices and higher prices at the pump and heat prices," he said. Maxwell noted the importance of having safe and secure elections. "We need ID's for our elections," he said. "We need a voter ID system in every state to validate your right to vote in this great America." White attributed the debate surrounding the 2020 election to "powers unseen." "This could have all been avoided if there weren't powers involved that we all know that are running it," White said. "I don't think Trump was one of the selected. I don't think we have voted for a candidate in a long time. The last one was [John F.] Kennedy. The people that stand up for the people end up hurt, kicked out or whatever." Westerman said the Democratic Party is using the 2020 election controversy and the Jan. 6 riot as distractions. "If I was Joe Biden I would run from my record as well," Westerman said. "Trump is not on the ballot. High food prices, high fuel costs, the debacle in Afghanistan and the attack on jobs -- that is what my district cares about." White agreed. "It's the news. They are the ones who are spreading it, and the government," he said. "They want us divided. Nobody wants to bring us together. Nobody is trying. We got to bring back JFK and Martin Luther King. We got to start loving each other like Jesus would like." Asked about Trump's responsibility related to the Jan. 6 riot, White repeated it is time to move on. "Here we go again. Let's get off Trump," he said. "I have a problem with it, but you can trigger a lot of people. Who died on Jan. 6? An Air Force veteran who was shot in the neck and a 63-year-old lady who was beaten to death by Capitol police. A Capitol police officer died from a stroke. Tell the truth and stop spreading lies." Maxwell said Trump isn't responsible for the Jan. 6 riot, but those who participated in it are. "The people were irresponsible," he said. "They were grown men. I hear a lot of talk about the insurrection on January 6, but people don't talk about all the protests. All the peaceful protests that erupted in fires in many cities. People just forget about the many fires and the fear they felt coming into the election. January 6 was just an outcry in the wrong direction." Westerman also described the congressional committee's review of the Jan. 6 incident as a made-for-TV spectacle. "The main issue is the economy and the bad policies they have made," Westerman said. "As far as Nancy Pelosi's made-for-TV committee, we often forget that the Justice Department has their own investigation going on. This committee has been at the behest of Speaker Pelosi the whole time and the Democrats who are trying to make it an issue. The American people are not concerned about January 6, but about January 20 when Biden became president and implemented his policies." White denied that the Jan. 6 incident was a riot. "It was not the worst day in American history. It was a big demonstration," White said. "You get 2 million Democrats together and you will have antifa, brown shirts and Black Lives Matter all together and they might burn that place down." Westerman took issue with White's notion the Jan. 6 riot was a demonstration. "I was in the Capitol the whole time. There was no excuse for it. It was a riot," he said. "It was a bad day in American history, but it's being looked into. It was a gift to Pelosi to make an issue out of, but the American people aren't concerned about Jan. 6 as much as the policies." White said after the debate that he chose to run as a Democrat because it was the party of Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr., despite having differences with the party's current platform. "The two greatest men in history were Democrats," he said. "Y'all lost your way. Someone has to set you straight. Neither of those men were in it for themselves. They were in it for the next generation and the ones after that. If those two men were not assisted we would be living in a totally different, peaceful world." White also said issues such as masks, vaccines, women competing in men's sports and transgender issues are all things the government uses to divide the people. "There is no difference between Democrat and Republican, and neither one of them cares about you," he said. "If they cared about you they would try to fix it." ABORTION Westerman said he is pro-life and fully supports Arkansas' decision to enact a trigger law that bans abortion in Arkansas except to save the life of the mother in a medical emergency. The trigger law was enacted earlier this year after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the landmark 1973 ruling in Roe v. Wade that legalized abortion across the nation. "From a legal standpoint it was the right decision," Westerman said. "The debate needs to take place at the state level, not in Washington, D.C. There never was a constitutional right for an abortion, it was a judicial right." White agreed, saying the U.S. Supreme Court made the right decision. "They sent the power back to the states according to the 10th Amendment," he said. "The Supreme Court is not allowed to make a law. They are there to determine if something is constitutional." White said he believes abortion got out of control over the past few decades. Maxwell said he also agreed with the idea of state rights but mentioned the decision yanked 50 years of progress out from underneath people. "It left them in a lurch," he said. "Men and women are responsible for an abortion. It takes two. We need to take care of the people left in the lurch because they are hurting." Westerman noted there was 200 years of precedent for not allowing an abortion before the U.S. Supreme Court made the decision to overturn Roe vs. Wade. "The foundation of our country is that we have inalienable rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness," he said. "If we don't have the right to life, then we don't have the other two." DEBT AND INFLATION Debate panelist Christina Munoz Madsen, a former TV anchor, asked candidates if they had a solution to bring down the national debt, which recently surpassed more than $31 trillion. Westerman said the Biden administration has been spending recklessly. "We are reaching the point where interest on the debt is going to be the number one expenditure," he said. "We've got to talk about these issues." Westerman said Americans need to ask themselves what they are getting from the spending over the past two years. "We need to have more transparency, and with Republicans in the majority we will have it," he said. White agreed and said he felt the federal government needs to pass a budget. "We need to go line by line to see where the money is going," he said. "Both parties have been throwing it out the window. They are printing it and throwing it out the window. A reckoning is coming, and we are all going to have to live with it. We can't pay it back, let's be honest." Maxwell said he agreed with the other candidates. "We need to look at our line items," he said.  Print Headline: Party disavows House hopefuls claims in debate

        A legislative panel on Monday endorsed the state's Employee Benefits Division's request for spending authority to use $52.7 million in federal American Rescue Plan funds to reimburse the state's public school and state employees' and retirees' health insurance plans for covid-19-related costs. The Legislative Council's Performance Evaluation and Expenditure Review Subcommittee recommended the Legislative Council approve the Employee Benefits Division's request. The council is slated to meet Friday. Employee Benefits Division Director Jake Bleed said on Monday that division officials have identified $52.7 million in expenses for the state's health insurance plans for public school and state employees that wouldn't have been paid if not for the covid-19 pandemic. He said he felt it's appropriate to ask for American Rescue Plan funds to reimburse these health insurance plans for the covid-19-related expenses. Arkansas' American Rescue Plan steering committee -- appointed by Gov. Asa Hutchinson in May 2021 to recommend the best uses of $1.57 billion in American Rescue Plan State Fiscal Recovery funds -- on Friday advanced the Employee Benefits Division's request for the federal funds. The state has roughly $400 million in unallocated American Rescue Plan State Fiscal Recovery funds, a state official has estimated. In March 2021, President Joe Biden signed the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan Act that is designed to help the United States recover from the economic and health effects of the covid-19 pandemic. In other action, the legislative subcommittee on Monday also recommended the Legislative Council approve the state Department of Human Service's request for spending authority to use $5 million in federal American Rescue Plan funds to support the training and certification of teams employed by behavioral health agencies in evidence-based models. The funds would be used to support the training and certification of the teams in the assertive community treatment model for adults with the highest level of mental health needs, and the intensive in-home support model to serve a similar population of children and youth in Arkansas who are involved with or at risk of involvement with the child welfare or juvenile justice system, the Department of Human Services said in its written request for the funds. To provide appropriate and adequate training, the department will contract with vendors to allow qualified behavioral health agencies to apply and complete training in these models, the department said. The subcommittee didn't act on several requests at the request of the finance department. The requests included a $9.59 million request from the state Department of Finance and Administration for Women & Children First to construct a new emergency shelter and a $4.6 million request from Black River Technical College to construct short-term training and housing facilities. The requests also include a $6 million request from University of Arkansas at Monticello, a $5 million request from Philander Smith College, a $5 million request from the Northwest Technical Institute Education Foundation, a $3.2 million request from Arkansas Tech University, a $3 million request from Southeast Arkansas College, and a $3 million request from the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff for building projects for health care-related programs. Department of Finance and Administration Secretary Larry Walther said state officials are checking into what other colleges and universities might want to submit requests for projects to help provide more nurses across the state, and assessing the need for nurses. They also are trying to figure out how to best assess hospitals' requests for American Rescue Plan funds, he said. Sen. Linda Chesterfield, D-Little Rock, said she's concerned the state's allocation of federal American Rescue Plan funds hasn't sufficiently helped minority communities impacted by covid-19. Walther said when the legislative panel considers requests to use these federal funds for building projects will depend on the Legislature and state officials completing their assessment of the need for nurses and what other colleges would like to submit requests for projects to educate more nurses. Rep. Michelle Gray, R-Melbourne, who is a co-chair of the Performance Evaluation and Expenditure Review Subcommittee, said she intends for the panel to consider the requests to use American Rescue Funds for building projects during its meeting in November. The panel also delayed action on the finance department's request for $20 million in state restricted reserve funds for two Arkansas Game and Fish Commission infrastructure projects. The Arkansas Game and Fish Commission requested $15 million for the renovation of about 13,000 acres of greentree reservoirs in the Bayou Meto Wildlife Management Area that have been negatively impacted by prolonged flooding, and $5 million to modernize how water is used, captured and reused at the Lonoke Fish Hatchery and increase the efficiency and capacity for fish production. Sen. Jonathan Dismang, R-Searcy, a co-chair of the Performance Evaluation and Expenditure Review Subcommittee, said state officials originally sought federal American Rescue Plan funds for the projects before deciding to seek state restricted reserve funds for the projects instead. "We are going to punt right now," he said. The subcommittee will consider the requests sometime in the future, Dismang said. ESSER FUNDS The legislative panel on Monday signed off on the state Department of Education's request for spending authority to disburse $18.8 million of the federal American Rescue Plan's Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund to 12 school districts. The Legislative Council's Performance Evaluation and Expenditure Review Committee authorized the spending authority, after lawmakers learned that six of the dozen school districts seeking more of their allocations of the federal funds have plans to provide the bonuses recommended by the Legislative Council in July. The recommended bonuses are $5,000 for teachers and $2,500 for full-time classified staff. The six districts with plans to use the federal funds to provide the recommended bonuses include the Calico Rock, Cotter, Geneo Central, Hillcrest, Lawrence County and Sloan-Hendrix school districts. The other six school districts seeking more of their allocations of the federal funds don't have plans to provide the recommended bonuses and provided an explanation for not doing so, according to a Bureau of Legislative Research analyst. They are the Blevins, Bradford, Harrison, Jackson County, Lakeside in Garland County, and McCory school districts. The spending authority of the federal funds authorized by the panel on Monday is the final tranche of American Rescue Plan funds that the panel has to review since the Legislative Council rescinded $500 million in spending authority from the state Department of Education on July 21 as part of its push for school districts to use the money on bonuses for teacher retention, before it voted to grant back $42 million of that spending authority.

         BENTONVILLE -- Vector Xiong, a Benton County Sheriff's Office detective, was identified by the office Monday as the detective who fatally shot a Decatur man Saturday. Xiong is on paid administrative leave while the Arkansas State Police investigates the shooting, according to Lt. Shannon Jenkins, the spokeswoman for the Sheriff's Office. Xiong has worked with the Sheriff's Office since March 16, 2015, Jenkins said. Sheriff's Office deputies were called to 22891 Falling Springs Road shortly before noon Saturday after a resident reported gunfire being heard on Nelson Amos' property, according to a news release from the State Police. Xiong encountered Amos, 71, on a local road driving a tractor and brandishing a handgun, according to the release. The deputy fired his rifle, striking Amos, according to the release. Amos was pronounced dead at the scene, according to the release. Special agents of the State Police's Criminal Investigation Division are preparing an investigative file to be submitted to Benton County Prosecuting Attorney Nathan Smith, who will determine whether the use of deadly force by the sheriff's detective was consistent with Arkansas laws, according to the release.

         Wade Derden, one of three finalists for the University of Arkansas-Pulaski Technical College chancellor position, came into his own as an educator while teaching at the school from 2001-2011 because he encountered students he never had before. Some lived out of their cars, while others were battling perilous family and/or domestic situations, but all were "trying to find their way out of their bad" circumstances, Derden said Monday during a public forum at UA-PTC's main campus in North Little Rock. "That transformed me personally -- the mission of community colleges unveiled before me -- we give students a path forward, helping them turn the impossible into possible." While the states and schools have "done a lot to address the financial needs of students in the past decade" -- which has opened college enrollment to more students -- "we haven't moved the needle much in terms of" success in college, he said. While financial constraints are certainly a hardship, "students need the support of a strong group of people -- a social network." "You're unable to navigate the bureaucracy of higher education alone," Derden said. He's seen this demonstrated in his own family, as well as with countless students, as "social networks are breaking or broken." Making connections with students is invaluable, but "we're not connecting with them like we should be," he said. "In some ways, we are not speaking the language of our students, [and we] need to show them how educational attainment links to their goals, [because] the degree is the step to the end goal for students. "We've got to be proactive and look at our policies and procedures on a continuous basis," he said. "We, as an institution, need to be thinking like [our students], and we owe it to every student to do everything we can to retain them." Enrollment at Pulaski Tech has decreased for three consecutive years, down to 4,223 this fall from 4,425 in 2021, 4,833 in 2020, and 5,531 in 2019. "What we're doing is not working," said Derden. But to him this is an opportunity to "be creative and break down old systems." Higher education has a reputation for being "slow to change." He said that "we need to shake it up," and that includes involving the community by instilling a value of higher education in communities, he said. "The solution to some of our immediate problems is to play the long game, to some extent," he said. "We have to be the college." A college isn't books, buildings, and computers, but rather, "the people," and those people must engage community members, he said. UA-PTC ought to be integrated into its community "so people look to us for educational attainment." UA-PTC should try to facilitate more paid internships so students get hands-on skills in the workplace, as well as having more events and community experts on campus, he said. It's paramount for "students and community partners to engage together." While visiting UA-PTC, Derden met with various campus, community, and University of Arkansas System stakeholders, a procedure that will be followed for the other two candidates, as well. Ted A. Lewis, provost/vice president of academic and student affairs at Bluefield State University in West Virginia, has his public forum at 3:45 p.m. today in the Campus Center, while Summer DeProw, provost/vice chancellor for academic and student affairs at UA-PTC, will have her public forum at the same time in the same place on Oct. 24. Livestreams of the forum are accessible online, with details available at https://bit.ly/3g4Vh0E. Among those in attendance Monday was Matthew Chase, an English professor at UA-PTC and member of the search committee who asked Derden about interacting with state legislators on funding and other issues if he'd become chancellor. It seemed "very important," as Derden mentioned multiple times UA-PTC's unique role as the state's only community college in an urban setting, and in the Capital, Chase said. Chase plans to attend each candidate forum, as "it seems a great gauge" of the finalists for the job. Derden "is a sixth-generation Arkansan who grew up in Central Arkansas and has served in education for more than two decades," according to the UA System. He first taught at Arkansas State University-Beebe on the Little Rock Air Force Base and at UA-PTC; upon appointment as a fulltime faculty member at the latter, Derden taught classes in history, political science, and the humanities. "I love this state, and the people of this state," he said. "I passionately want to help students be successful, and I'm a classroom teacher at heart." "This college has changed a lot since I was last here" -- although he did wear the same tie Monday he wore to the last UA-PTC graduation he attended as a faculty member -- so "I will involve you all in this vision," he said. "I'm not a person to think I have all the answers. I'm more collaborative [and] I'll ask a lot of questions." "I want to know why we do things, and I'll challenge norms and push for innovation as chancellor," he said. "I'll expect everyone to support every student every day." Derden, who received his Ph.D. in public policy from the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, chaired the Social Science Division before becoming National Park College's vice president, and his thesis for his Master of Arts at UA-Fayetteville explored Southern masculinity and religion, according to the UA System. Derden, who has a Bachelor of Arts degree in history from Hendrix College, is "a past-president of the Arkansas Community College's Board of Directors, a Governor Asa Hutchinson-appointee to the Criminal Justice Institute Board of Advisors, and a peer reviewer for the Higher Learning Commission." The UA-PTC search committee evaluated applicants from 17 states, and interim Chancellor Ana Hunt, who did not apply for the fulltime chancellor job, "will continue to serve as interim until one of the finalists is chosen and begins their work at" the college, according to the UA System. Hunt was appointed interim by UA System President Donald Bobbitt in June following the retirement of then-Chancellor Margaret Ellibee, who announced in January her intent to retire effective June 30. UA-PTC, the UA System's largest two-year college, was established in 1945 as a vocational-technical school, but it has evolved through the years to meet varying education needs, according to the UA System. In addition to its main campus in North Little Rock, the college has locations across Pulaski and Saline Counties.  Print Headline: Chancellor finalist visits UA-PTC

         A pro-recreational marijuana legalization group backed by the state's medical cannabis industry raised $850,000 in September, but anti-cannabis advocates have more cash on hand. Responsible Growth Arkansas, a non-profit group that supports the proposed constitutional amendment to legalize recreational cannabis, raised $850,000 almost entirely from the state's medical cannabis industry, according to financial statements filed with the Arkansas Ethics Commission. Responsible Growth Arkansas helped lead the push to get the recreational marijuana question on the November ballot. If the amendment is approved by voters, people 21 or older will be able to legally possess up to one ounce of marijuana in Arkansas. Medical marijuana became legal in Arkansas after voters approved a constitutional amendment in 2016 to authorize the drug for medical use. If the latest amendment passes, Arkansas medical cannabis dispensaries would be allowed to sell recreational marijuana. The amendment would limit the number of licensed recreational marijuana dispensaries to 120. The state limit on the number of medical marijuana dispensary licenses is 40. Bold Team LLC, a medical marijuana cultivation and processing business in Cotton Plant, and Good Day Farm LLC, which has four medical dispensaries in Arkansas and 18 in Missouri, donated $300,000 each to Responsible Growth Arkansas in September. In total, both businesses have contributed $1 million to the group. As of Sept. 30, Responsible Growth Arkansas has raised a total of $4.86 million and had $945,558 in cash on hand. In September, the group spent $404,594, mostly on advertising. Targeted Platform Media received $236,786 from the group for advertising. Other funds were largely spent on consulting and legal services. In contrast, the main group against the amendment is largely backed by two wealthy donors but failed to raise similar cash in September. Safe and Secure Communities, which supported the legal effort to get the marijuana amendment removed from the ballot, raised just $10,347 in September. The group's fundraising in September came largely from one donor, Gregory Hartz, a financial analyst from Little Rock. The group still has $1.32 million in its cash balance, largely thanks to two donors who contributed a combined $1.75 million to the group in August. Mountaire Corporation CEO Ronald M. Cameron of Little Rock donated $1 million to Safe and Secure Communities in August, while Richard Uihlein of Lake Bluff, Ill., donated $750,000. Safe and Secure Communities spent $619,000 in September, mostly on advertising to the Arlington, Va., based Nebo Media Inc. The Family Council Action Committee, which is running campaigns against the recreational marijuana amendment and in support of the proposed religious freedom amendment, received a $50,000 contribution from Cameron for its anti-cannabis push. Cameron, a Republican Party donor, also contributed $10,000 to the group's campaign for the proposed religious freedom amendment. Both donations made up almost all of the group's fundraising on both campaigns.  Print Headline: Recreational pot backers raised $850,000 in September

         The IDEA Public Charter Schools Arkansas organization is giving up plans -- at least for now -- to open two open-enrollment charter school campuses in central Arkansas. The sponsoring organization of the two planned kindergarten-through-12th grade campuses in Pulaski County recently sent notice to Arkansas education leaders about the change, attributing it in part to "dramatically increased start-up and operating costs." "It is with a heavy heart that IDEA Public Schools Arkansas hereby surrenders its charter, granted by the state Board of Education on September 9, 2021, which authorized it to launch schools starting in 2023 (later amended to 2024)," Dan Fishman, senior vice president for growth, wrote. Fishman's letter is on the agenda for review at today's 9 a.m. Arkansas Charter Authorizing Panel meeting. "While IDEA remains committed to getting students from under-served communities to and through college, and while IDEA hopes to one day be able to serve students and families throughout Arkansas, current conditions do not allow it to proceed with planned launches in Arkansas," Fishman wrote. "The combination of dramatically increased start-up and operating costs, coupled with the need to focus on existing IDEA regions, has led IDEA to this decision," he continued. "We apologize for any inconvenience this causes you and hope that, with your permission, IDEA is able to work together with local communities in the future to educate Arkansas students." The charter school organization, started more than 20 years ago, operates 143 IDEA charter schools in Texas, Ohio, Florida and southern Louisiana, according to its website. IDEA stands for Individuals Dedicated to Excellence and Achievement. The organization had received Arkansas approval in 2021 to open two campuses within the borders of the Little Rock and Pulaski County Special school districts, beginning with the 2023-24 school year. Each of the campuses was to start with kindergarten, first-, second- and sixth-grades in their inaugural year, and eventually grow to offer kindergarten-through-12th grades. Earlier this year, the charter school planners had asked for and received from Arkansas education leaders permission to delay opening until the 2024-25 school year. The extra time was needed to train school leaders in the IDEA school model and "to secure facilities that allow us to serve communities where demand and need are greatest," the school planners said. No specific locations for the schools were ever publicly announced. The organization's mission is preparing students from under-served communities for success in college and for citizenship. Planners told Arkansas charter school authorizers in 2021 that the elementary and middle school programs would include standardized testing three times a year to track progress and a "critical student intervention" strategy to help low-achieving students to make two years of academic growth in a single year. School plans also called for high school students to take at least 11 Advanced Placement courses along with courses on how to attend and get through college. The students were to visit at least 10 colleges and universities, and apply to a minimum of six -- all with the guidance of school-employed college counselors. One hundred percent of IDEA graduates are accepted into college annually, the school planners said in 2021. Arkansas has issued 24 charters in this 2022-23 school year for the operation of open-enrollment, public charter schools that are run by non-profit organizations other than traditional school districts.

         After a power outage caused by a fire Sunday night in downtown Little Rock affected over 170 customers, and an Entergy spokesperson said Monday that power had been almost completely restored. Brandi Hinkle, a spokesperson for Entergy, said Monday afternoon most of the power had been restored except for at the Pulaski County Courthouse and at least one street light. Hinkle said in a telephone interview Monday afternoon that the goal is to return power to the courthouse Monday night. "If not at 10 p.m. tonight, we're aiming for 7 a.m. tomorrow," she said. The power outage in downtown Little Rock late Sunday, caused by a nearby fire, affected the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette and KATV, Channel 7, along with other customers, according to Entergy Arkansas' online outage map. Little Rock firefighters responded to a manhole fire near West Second Street and Broadway around 10:30 p.m., spokesman Capt. Jason Weaver said on Sunday. The manhole fire caused smoke to drift across the downtown area, Weaver said. Fires related to manholes can sometimes disrupt electricity lines. On Monday Capt. Jacob Lear-Sadowsky, a spokesman for the Little Rock Fire Department said firefighters responded to an electrical underground fire on Sunday. "There was a fire in one of the vaults downtown and Entergy made the decision to cut the power," said Lear-Sadowsky. Hinkle said sparks from an underground equipment malfunction caused a fire to start. "It's not unusual for electrical equipment to have some sparks," she said, "But the sparks led to some of our wires starting to burn." Lear-Sadowsky said there were flames barely visible just above the manhole, but it was not a larger fire than what they'd expect to see. He said the firefighters cleared the scene just after 11:45 p.m. on Sunday. Neither Hinkle or Lear-Sadowsky could say if there was any extensive damage to the equipment. Hinkle said the cause of the malfunction and the investigation into how damaged the equipment is remains ongoing.  Print Headline: Fire causes power outage in downtown LR

         The University of Arkansas at Monticello's Megan Hotard placed second in the barrel riding competition at the Annual University of West Alabama Rodeo Showdown, Sept. 28-Oct 1. It was Hotard's second rodeo as a Boll Weevil. Aubrey Lee, a native of Mount Vernon, also took second place in the average breakaway roping competition at Alabama. Hotard is a transfer student from the University of Louisiana at Monroe. ULM doesn't have a collegiate rodeo program, so transferring to UAM allowed her to compete at the collegiate level. Hotard said she had not competed since high school, but she faced off against 118 girls in the West Alabama Showdown. "It was nerve-wracking going down the alley," the junior said. "You know, you're competing against some good girls from all across the country, and when you compete at that level, it can be a lot of pressure, but I felt like I had the horse to get me to the short round and I just knew I had to go in there and keep the barrels up and stay out of his way." Hotard was on a borrowed horse from a friend. Her horse Ashes stayed at home, as she had some injuries and vision problems. Hotard adds she had only ridden the borrowed horse one time before the competition. Besides barrels, Hotard competes in breakaway and team roping. Lee also experienced success in Alabama. Lee won the short round in breakaway against nine other finalists. The competition started with 80 competitors. Lee said she was happy with her horse Zan's performance. "I guess he just kind of he does his thing. He worked well, and he just helped me to where I needed so I could execute," said Lee. UAM Rodeo Coach Rusty Jones has a lot of optimism about this year's 13-member team. "We're fixing to get the ball rolling; we have some new kids. We're trying to get over the new-kid-on-the block jitters. I'm pretty optimistic about going forward," said Jones. Jones said overall the women's team placed fourth in Livingston. Before each rodeo, Jones selects four individuals to count toward the team scoring. Jones said with so many new people on the team, picking the four team members can be difficult. The Alabama venue was only the second event of the fall season. Jones is still assessing individuals on this year's team. Jones said the team had a weekend off and then went to Sikeston, Mo., for the Three Rivers Championship Rodeo held Oct. 13-15. The Rodeo Team at UAM is a member of the Ozark Region of the National Intercollegiate Rodeo Association. The university provides scholarships and support for competitions. The University of Arkansas at Monticello and the University of Arkansas System Division of Agriculture offer all of their programs to all eligible persons without discrimination. Lon Tegels is with the University of Arkansas at Monticello.  Print Headline: 2 UAM competitors place 2nd at rodeo

         Sheridan Elementary School won a $1,000 "Champion of School Garden Sustainability" award from the Arkansas Department of Agriculture and Farm Credit Associations of Arkansas. SES was one of 10 winners at the 2022 Arkansas Grown School Garden of the Year Contest. October is Arkansas Farm to School month, and contest winners were selected as part of the celebration. The event was held Wednesday at Pinnacle View Middle School at Little Rock, according to a news release. The "Champion of School Garden Sustainability" category recognizes one school that had previously won a contest category and has woven the school garden program into the foundation of the school culture. The $1,000 award will go to support the school garden. Either Sheridan Elementary or Sheridan Intermediate has been an award winner in the contest five of the past six years, according to County Extension Agent Brad McGinley. "Our school garden wouldn't be possible without the partnership of Brad McGinley with SES teachers, Cindy Whitaker and Carla Marsh," said SES Principal Lindsey Bohler. "Their dedication and love for gardening with our students shines bright every year. We are thankful for these opportunities for our kids." Farm Credit Associations of Arkansas provides the funding for the program. "As a farmer-owned cooperative, we believe it's important to support local food system initiatives such as the Arkansas Grown School Garden Program," Brandon Haberer, Farm Credit of Western Arkansas chief executive officer, said on behalf of the Farm Credit Associations of Arkansas. "Local food projects like this are a great way to educate the next generation and the public about food production and agriculture." The contest was available to public and private K-12 schools, early childhood education facilities, and alternative learning environments. "School gardens provide a hands-on opportunity for children to learn about Arkansas agriculture and where their food comes from," said Arkansas Secretary of Agriculture Wes Ward. "The lessons learned through school gardens have a lasting impact on children, their families, and entire communities."  Print Headline: Sheridan school gets $1,000 garden award

         Former University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff Chancellor Lawrence A. Davis Jr., who died Saturday at age 85, is remembered as a man who transformed a school that was faced with a $3 million deficit when he took over in 1991, helped it blossom with new academic buildings and renovated housing over the next two decades. Yet, one of his most notable acts of leadership took place in the sports realm, when an otherwise successful football program hit an all-time low. Chris Robinson, now UAPB's athletic director, was a young quarterback from Mobile, Ala., when the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics shut down the Golden Lions football team for the 1991 season for 41 rules violations concerning player eligibility. As with many university cities, football has been a source of school and community pride in Pine Bluff for decades. "It was unfortunate we received the death penalty," Robinson said. "He came to us with the decision and explained it to us. He didn't want to do it, but him being an athlete himself, he understood this was something no one wanted, but it was unfortunate we were handed this." The NAIA handed down the stiff penalty in December 1990. Davis, a former basketball player at what was then Arkansas AM&N College, became chancellor the following November, so it was not immediately clear what his role was at UAPB other than being an administrator at the time. What was clear to Robinson, however, was Davis' commitment to each student-athlete on a team that had just finished 8-2, the school's best record since 1946. "He was committed to us," Robinson said. "We chose the university, so he chose us as well. Every student-athlete, he was going to honor our scholarships because he wanted us to be students first." Robinson stayed at UAPB during that quiet fall in 1991 but transferred to Southern University the next year, since UAPB elected to sit out another season. For those who stayed, Davis honored their scholarships again, Robinson said. When he realized he would have just one year left in NCAA eligibility and two years left in NAIA eligibility, he returned to UAPB when the football program was relaunched for the 1993 season. The next year, Robinson quarterbacked the Golden Lions to a national runner-up finish, one of many benchmarks they achieved with Davis at the helm of an entire campus. Davis led UAPB's efforts to move into NCAA Division I and rejoin the Southwestern Athletic Conference in 1997. Three years later, the 16,000-seat Golden Lion Stadium opened, replacing the aging Pumphrey Stadium that packed maybe half of that during the 1994 national final against eventual winner Northeastern State University of Oklahoma. "Dr. Davis is a man that deserves as much attention and recognition as possible for his vision, his efforts, his tenacity and his willingness to go the distance with the student-athlete," Robinson said. Jefferson County Sheriff Lafayette Woods Jr., who graduated from UAPB in 2004, said in a news release "it's pretty easy" to recognize the impact of the legacy Davis left on the campus. "Dr. Davis brought personal warmth and wisdom to the commencement ceremonies for hundreds of graduates," said Woods. "He was a stalwart supporter and champion for all students. You can always measure how much an instructor or administrator valued you as a student when your relationship extends beyond the four walls of the classroom. Dr. Davis supported me well after graduation and I am forever grateful for his mentorship." Davis' impact on UAPB stretches from eliminating a substantial financial debt to adding academic buildings and moving an athletic program to a higher level of competition. His achievements are not lost on someone who was a key player in Golden Lion football's resurgence under Davis' watch and is now a campus administrator himself. "He was a die-hard UAPB guy," Robinson said. "He bled black and gold. He was all about the university. He was out there among the students. He was very active. Chancellor [Laurence B.] Alexander is as well. Very visible, very reachable. "I know [Davis] had that great lineage with his family. He was very intentional about UAPB and put it in the best light."

         Little Rock City Manager Bruce Moore on Monday said he received a call from an Arkansas Legislative Audit official last week who asked him to ensure that no documents regarding LITFest were deleted or destroyed. The conversation with Kim Williams, an assistant legislative auditor, took place on Wednesday, according to Moore. When asked if he was informed that officials were considering doing an audit, Moore said no. The extent of the brief conversation was "to make sure that there were no documents deleted or destroyed regarding LITFest," Moore said in an interview. Legislative Audit has not asked for any information at this point, he said. As a result of the call, city department heads were told not to destroy or delete any information on LITFest and also to alert the appropriate staff members, Moore said. When asked if his operating assumption was not that the city was under some kind of investigation or audit, Moore said, "Correct." Williams declined to comment when reached by phone Monday. Little Rock Mayor Frank Scott Jr. had promoted LITFest as an exciting new city festival, and the weekend of music and panel discussions was ultimately scheduled for Oct. 7-9, only to collapse shortly before its debut. On Oct. 3, Moore terminated a contract with the public-affairs firm Think Rubix that was tied to the festival, after City Attorney Tom Carpenter expressed concerns about the financial arrangement with the firm. The following day, Scott acknowledged LITFest would not take place. Moore had signed the agreement with Think Rubix on June 9. At the time, the firm had recently hired Scott's former chief of staff Charles Blake, who left his city job in late January. Additionally, a top Think Rubix official, Tristan Wilkerson, contributed thousands of dollars to Scott's first campaign for mayor, and the Scott campaign reported paying Think Rubix at least $1,500 in consultant fees. The signed LITFest contract said the city would pay Think Rubix up to $45,000 to help produce the festival. Records that were later obtained by attorney Matthew Campbell, the author of the "Blue Hog Report" blog, showed officials at the city and Think Rubix discussed sending sponsorship money to a nonprofit group affiliated with the firm. Campbell published a video of a procurement meeting from earlier this year in which Kendra Pruitt, Scott's current chief of staff, suggested using sponsorship dollars as an additional source of funding to avoid the $50,000 threshold that would have required the Think Rubix contract to go before the Little Rock Board of Directors. Legislative Audit staff serve the Arkansas General Assembly and the Legislative Joint Auditing Committee by pursuing financial audits, internal control and compliance assessments, investigative reports and more that examine state and local government entities, according to the Legislative Audit handbook. Lawmakers can submit a request for a special audit, report or investigation outside of Legislative Audit's normal scope of work to the co-chairs of the Legislative Joint Auditing Committee for the approval of its executive committee, the handbook says.

        VAN BUREN -- A variety of projects throughout Crawford County were given the final go-ahead for funding, including a new emergency communication center. The Crawford County Quorum Court approved nine ordinances appropriating more than $1.6 million combined of the county's American Rescue Plan money at its regular meeting Monday. The county Budget Committee approved the recommendations that called for spending this money at a meeting earlier in the evening. The recommendations came from funding requests the county American Rescue Plan Committee approved Oct. 4. The largest recommendation was $517,205 to provide machinery and equipment for an emergency communication center that's being built next to the Sheriff's Office and jail. County Judge Dennis Gilstrap, who made the original request, has said $132,614 of this amount will go toward building a new communication tower, $11,561 for concept seating, $79,908 for base consoles and accessories and $293,123 for radios. Gilstrap said Monday the county is "very excited" about the Quorum Court approving the money for this project with the upcoming relocation of its consolidated 911 call center from the Sheriff's Office into its own facility and upgrades to the county's communication system. "All of this with all the upgrades, these are things without the American Rescue Plan funds that we wouldn't be able to fund and do," Gilstrap said. The county consolidated all three call centers in its 911 system into one call center in January to bring the system into compliance with the Public Safety Act of 2019. The system up to that point included facilities at the Van Buren and Alma police departments. The Quorum Court approved using more than $1.03 million in American Rescue Plan money to build the center itself March 21. A groundbreaking for the building was held Sept. 23. Gilstrap said the county hopes the new facility will be finished by May. The Budget Committee also approved a recommendation to provide the county Sheriff's Office $376,820 to buy six vehicles. It gave the green light for $300,000 to go toward a new roof and nine new air conditioning units for the county Circuit Clerk's Office in Van Buren as well. The other recommendations the Budget Committee approved Monday were: $163,484 for the nonprofit Crawford County Senior Citizens for operations. $163,000 for the Crawford County Health Unit for a new roof and some interior and exterior maintenance for its building. $41,580 for the county Assessor's Office to pay for an aerial flyover for property assessment purposes. $40,000 for the Crawford County Adult Education Center for a computer program pertaining to workforce training. $33,000 for Gilstrap to reimburse the county's bond forfeiture fund for a project to build a jury room for Division I of the county Circuit Court. $3,891 for the county District Court to fix some doors to help address security issues at its building in Van Buren. Beverly Pyle, county treasurer, has said the county received more than $6.1 million in American Rescue Plan money in June. It received the same amount last year for more than $12.2 million total.  None  Communication Center Project Constructing the new Crawford County emergency communication center is expected to cost about $1.6 million in American Rescue Plan money.

         VAN BUREN -- The Crawford County Sheriff's Office is investigating after a county jail inmate died over the weekend. Sheriff Jimmy Damante said Monday that Jacob Allen Jones, 26, of Van Buren had a medical emergency at the jail on Saturday, although he couldn't provide specifics on the nature of the emergency or at what time it took place. A deputy went to check on Jones after he didn't come up to get his tray during a scheduled feeding time. "His uncle was also in there and told the deputy that something's going on with him, so they went in immediately, started CPR," Damante said. Damante said Jones reportedly had a slight heartbeat when he was loaded into an ambulance, but he was pronounced dead at a local hospital. Jones had been booked into the jail Friday afternoon on two counts of failure to appear and one count of obstructing governmental operations, according to the Sheriff's Office's online inmate roster. He was being held on a bond totaling $50,240. Damante said Jones' body was sent to the Arkansas State Crime Laboratory in Little Rock for examination, including an autopsy. He said he didn't believe Arkansas State Police would investigate Jones' death, with the Sheriff's Office conducting a "complete investigation" since Saturday. Bill Sadler, Arkansas State Police spokesman, said the agency would only investigate such an inmate death upon the request of a local jurisdiction or prosecuting attorney.

        BENTONVILLE -- Northwest Arkansas Community College's Board of Trustees on Monday unanimously approved bonuses for faculty and staff that will cost the college about $438,000. The college had 149 full-time faculty and 243 full-time staff as of September, according to the college. The $1,000 bonus for faculty would total $165,986 and the $1,000 bonus for staff would total $272,099, according to a presentation given at Monday's board meeting. The decision followed a report from the Finance Committee, which recommended the bonuses during its Oct. 5 meeting. The college was able to fund the bonuses because of revenue from higher than anticipated enrollment this fall, said President Dennis Rittle. The college reported a preliminary count of 7,839 students taking courses for academic credit as of Sept. 7, the fall semester's 11th day of classes. That represented an increase of 802 students, or 10.7%, from the same point last fall semester -- the college's largest increase by percentage in over a decade. College officials originally expected enrollment to be down 2%, Rittle said, and the budget for this fiscal year was set accordingly in the spring. The board approved a budget of about $41.9 million for fiscal 2023. The board also this year approved the college's first tuition increase since 2013. The bonuses were to reward employees for a job well done, Rittle said. Trustee Ron Branscum, who presented the Finance Committee report, said the bonuses were a great opportunity to show appreciation to faculty and staff. The bonus request now must be submitted to the Arkansas Department of Higher Education, then to the Arkansas Legislative Council Personnel Committee for approval on Nov. 16. The plan is to disburse the bonuses on Dec. 2, according to the presentation. A concurrent enrollment update was given at the meeting. From fall 2021 to fall 2022, concurrent enrollment -- high school students who are also enrolled in college classes -- was up 26% at the college. Trustee DeAnne Witherspoon mentioned the potential for the program to grow.  Print Headline: College trustees approve bonuses for faculty, staff
